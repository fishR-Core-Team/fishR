The following packages are loaded for use below. I also set the default `ggplot` theme to `theme_bw()` for a classic "black-and-white" plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).

```{r packages}
library(FSA)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

# Introduction
Age-bias and difference plots can be constructed with `plot()` and `plotAB()` in the `FSA` package. However, these types of plots can be more flexibly constructed using `ggplot2`. Below I will use `ggplot2` to recreate many of the plots shown in the documentation for [`plot()`](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSA/reference/ageBias.html#examples) and [`plotAB()`](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSA/reference/plotAB.html#examples).

&nbsp;

# Data
The `WhitefishLC` data frame from `FSA`.^[These data are loaded automatically with `library(FSA)`.] contains age readings made by two readers on scales, fin rays, and otoliths, along with consensus readings for each structure.

```{r}
head(WhitefishLC)
```

Intermediate and summary statistics for the comparison of paired ages (e.g., between consensus scale and otolith ages) can be extracted from the objected returned by `ageBias()` from `FSA`.^[As described in [the documentation](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSA/reference/ageBias.html).] 

```{r}
ab1 <- ageBias(scaleC~otolithC,data=WhitefishLC,
               ref.lab="Otolith Age",nref.lab="Scale Age")
```

For example, the `$data` object of `ab1`^[`ab1` because that was the name assigned to the results from `ageBias()` in **this** example.] contains the original paired age estimates, the differences between those two estimates, and the mean of those two estimates.

```{r}
head(ab1$data)
```

In addition, the `$bias` object of `ab1` contains summary statistics of ages for the first structure given in the `ageBias()` formula by each age of the second structure given in that formula. For example, the first row below gives the number, minimum, maximum, mean, and standard error of the scale ages that were paired with an otolith age of 1. Additionally there is a t-test, adjusted p-value, and a significance statement for testing whether the mean scale age is different from the otolith age. Finally, confidence intervals (defaults to 95%) for the mean scale age at an otolith age of 1 is given, with a statement about whether a confidence interval could be calculated.^[See [the documentation](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSA/reference/ageBias.html) for `ageBias()` for the criterion used to decide if the confidence interval can be calculated.]

```{r}
head(ab1$bias)
```

The results in `$bias.diff` are similar to those for `$bias` except that the *difference* in age between the two structures is summarized for each otolith age.

```{r}
head(ab1$bias.diff)
```

These data frames are used in `ggplot2` code below to create various versions of age-bias and difference plots.

:::{.callout-important}
At times multiple data frames will be used when constructing the same plot so that layers of the plot can have different variables.

# Basic Age-Bias Plot
@fig-plotAB is the age-bias plot created by default by `plotAB()` from `FSA`.

```{r}
#| label: fig-plotAB
#| fig-cap: Default age-bias plot from `plotAB()` in `FSA`.
#| fig-alt: Default age-bias plot from plotAB() in FSA.
#| echo: -1
par(mar=c(3,3,0.5,0.5),mgp=c(1.9,0.5,0),tcl=-0.2)
FSA::plotAB(ab1)
```

&nbsp;

@fig-plotAB is largely recreated (@fig-plotAB2) with the following `ggplot2` code.

```{r}
#| label: fig-plotAB2
#| fig-cap: Recreation of the default age-bias plot using `ggplot2`.
#| fig-alt: Recreation of the default age-bias plot using ggplot2.
ggplot(data=ab1$bias) +
  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype="dashed",color="gray") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),width=0) +
  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),shape=21) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("FALSE"="black","TRUE"="white"),guide="none") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("FALSE"="black","TRUE"="red3"),guide="none") +
  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +
  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)
```

The specifics of the code above are described below.

* The base data used in this plot is the `$bias` data.frame discussed above.
* The 45^o^ agreement line (i.e., slope of 1 and intercept of 0) is added with `geom_abline()`, using a dashed `linetype=` and a gray `color=`. This "layer" is first so that it sits behind the other results.
* Error bars are added with `geom_errorbar()`. The `aes()`thetics here map the consensus otolith age to the `x=` axis and the lower and upper confidence interval values for the mean consensus scale age at each consensus otolith age to `ymin=` and `ymax=`. The `color=` of the lines are mapped to the `sig` variable so that points that are significantly different from the 45^o^ agreement line will have a different color (with `scale_color_manual()` described below). Finally, `width=0` assures that the error bars will not have "end caps."
* Points at the mean consensus scale age (`y=`) for each otolith age (`x=`) are added with `geom_point()`. Again, the `color=` and `fill=` are mapped to the `sig` variable so that they will appear different depending on whether the points are significantly different from the 45^o^ agreement line or not. Finally, `shape=21` represents a plotted point as an open circle that is outlined with `color=` and filled with `fill=`.
* `scale_fill_manual()` and `scale_color_manual()` are used to set the colors and fills for the levels in the `sig` variable. Note that `guide="none"` is used so that a legend is not constructed for the colors and fills.
* `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()` are used to set the labels (with `name=`) and axis breaks for the x- and y-axes, respectively. The names are drawn from labels that were given in the original call to `ageBias()` and stored in `ab1`.

The gridlines and the size of the fonts could be adjusted by modifying theme theme, which I did not do here for simplicity.

# More Examples
Below are more examples of how `ggplot2` can be used to recreate graphs from `plot()` in `FSA`. For example, @fig-ABplot1 is similar to @fig-plotAB2, but uses `$bias.diff` from `ab1` to plot mean differences between scale and otolith ages against otolith ages. The reference for differences is a horizontal line at 0 so `geom_abline()` from above was replaced with `geom_hline()` here.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ABplot1
#| fig-cap: Age difference plot using `ggplot2`.
#| fig-alt: Age difference plot using ggplot2.
ggplot(data=ab1$bias.diff) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype="dashed",color="gray") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),width=0) +
  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),shape=21) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("FALSE"="black","TRUE"="white"),guide="none") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("FALSE"="black","TRUE"="red3"),guide="none") +
  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +
  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,"-",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5)
```

@fig-ABplot2 is similar but it includes the raw data points from `$data` and colors the mean (and confidence intervals) for the differences based on the significance as in @fig-plotAB2. Because data were drawn from different data frames (i.e., `ab1$data` and `ab1$bias.diff`) the `data=` and `aes=` arguments had to be moved into the specific `geom_`s. Also note that the raw data were made semi-transparent (with `alpha=0.1`) to emphasize the over-plotting of the discrete ages.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ABplot2
#| fig-cap: Age difference plot using `ggplot2` including points for individual observations.
#| fig-alt: Age difference plot using `ggplot2` including points for individual observations.
ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype="dashed",color="gray") +
  geom_point(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),alpha=0.1,size=1.75) +
  geom_errorbar(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),
                width=0) +
  geom_point(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),
             shape=21,size=1.75) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("FALSE"="black","TRUE"="white"),guide="none") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("FALSE"="black","TRUE"="red3"),guide="none") +
  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=seq(0,25,1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,"-",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5)
```

&nbsp;

@fig-ABplot3 is the same as @fig-ABplot2 except that a loess smoother has been added with `geom_smooth()` to emphasize the trend in the differences in ages. The smoother should be fit to the raw data so be sure to use `ab1$data` in `geom_smooth()`. The smoother defaults to blue (as shown here) but I decreased the width of the line slightly with `linewidth=0.65`.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ABplot3
#| fig-cap: Age difference plot using `ggplot2` including points for individual observations and a loess smoother.
#| fig-alt: Age difference plot using ggplot2 including points for individual observations and a loess smoother.

  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype="dashed",color="gray") +
  geom_point(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),alpha=0.1,size=1.75) +
  geom_errorbar(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),
                width=0) +
  geom_point(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),
             shape=21,size=1.75) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("FALSE"="black","TRUE"="white"),guide="none") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("FALSE"="black","TRUE"="red3"),guide="none") +
  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=seq(0,25,1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,"-",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5) +
  geom_smooth(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),linewidth=0.65)
```

# What Prompted This
Graphics made in `ggplot2` are more flexible than the ones produced in `FSA`. For example, a user recently asked if it was possible to make an "age-bias plot" that used "error bars" based on the standard deviation rather than the standard error. While it is questionable whether this is what should be plotted, it is nevertheless up to the user and their use case. Because this cannot be done using the plots in `FSA` we turned to `ggplot` to make such a graph.

Standard deviations are not returned in any of the `ageBias()` results (saved in `ab1`). However, the standard error and sample size are returned in the `$bias` data frame. The standard deviation can be "back-calculated" from these two values using `SD=SE*sqrt(n)`. Two new variables called `LSD` and `USD` that are the means minus and plus two standard deviations can then be created. All three of these variables are added to the `$bias` data frame using `mutate()` from `dplyr`.

```{r}
ab1$bias <- ab1$bias %>%
  mutate(SD=SE*sqrt(n),
         LSD=mean-2*SD,
         USD=mean+2*SD)
```

A plot (@fig-ABplot4) like the very first plot above but using two standard deviations for the error bars is then created by mapping `ymin=` and `ymax=` to `LSD` and `USD`, respectively, in `geom_errorbar()`. Note that I removed the color related to the significance test as those don't pertain to the results when using standard deviations to represent "error bars."

```{r}
#| label: fig-ABplot4
#| fig-cap: Mean scale age for each otolith age with error bars represented by two standard deviations.
#| fig-alt: Mean scale age for each otolith age with error bars represented by two standard deviations.
ggplot(data = ab1$bias)+
  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype="dashed",color="gray") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LSD,ymax=USD),width=0) +
  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean)) +
  scale_x_continuous(name =ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +
  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)
```

Finally, to demonstrate the flexibility of using `ggplot` with these type of data, I used a violin plot to show the distribution of scale ages for each otolith age while also highlighting the mean scale age for each otolith age (@fig-ABplot5). The violin plots are created with `geom_violin()` using the raw data stored in `$data`. The `group=` must be set to the x-axis variable (i.e., otolith age) so that a separate violin will be constructed for each age on the x-axis. I `fill`ed the violins with `grey` to make them stand out more.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ABplot5
#| fig-cap: Violin plots and mean scale age at each otolith age.
#| fig-alt: Violin plots and mean scale age at each otolith age.
ggplot() +
  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype="dashed",color="gray") +
  geom_violin(data=WhitefishLC,aes(x=otolithC,y=scaleC,group=otolithC),
              fill="grey") +
  geom_point(data=ab1$bias,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean),size=2) +
  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +
  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)
```

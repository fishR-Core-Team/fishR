A reader of @ogleIntroductoryFisheriesAnalyses2016 asked how to compute standard errors (SE) for the various PSD indices with the usual SE equation of a proportion (i.e., $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$. I demonstrate this calculation in this post

:::{.callout-warning}
I caution against using these standard errors to produce confidence intervals for PSD-X values. If confidence intervals are the end product for this analysis, then I suggest using the binomial or multinomial distribution methods described in @ogleIntroductoryFisheriesAnalyses2016.

I will use the same Inch Lake data from the Size Structure chapter of @ogleIntroductoryFisheriesAnalyses2016, where I used `psdAdd()` (from `FSA`) to add a variable with the Gabelhouse length categories and eliminated all sub-stock size fish.^[this and next step is from [this script](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/scripts/SizeStructure.R)) from @ogleIntroductoryFisheriesAnalyses2016.]

```{r}
#| message: true
inchAlls <- read.csv("http://derekogle.com/IFAR/scripts/InchLake1113.csv") |>
  mutate(gcat=psdAdd(tl,species)) |>
  filter(gcat!="substock") |>
  droplevels()
headtail(inchAlls)
```

I then computed the PSD-X values as shown in @ogleIntroductoryFisheriesAnalyses2016. These will be the proportions (i.e., $p$) in the SE calculations.

```{r}
( freq <- xtabs(~species+gcat,data=inchAlls) )
iPSDs <- prop.table(freq,margin=1)*100
( PSDs <- t(apply(iPSDs,MARGIN=1,FUN=rcumsum)) )
```

The row sums from the `freq` table are the total number of fish (that are stock size or greater) and will be $n$ in the SE calculations.

```{r}
( sums <- rowSums(freq) )
```

Finally, with these two results the SE for PSD-Q may be computed.
```{r}
p <- PSDs[,"quality"]
SEs <- sqrt(p*(100-p)/sums)
round(SEs,1)
```

And can be repeat for other size indices; e.g., for PSD-P.
```{r}
p <- PSDs[,"preferred"]
SEs <- sqrt(p*(100-p)/sums)
round(SEs,1)
```

:::{.callout-note}
The SE formula is usually used for proportions (and then multiplied by 100 to get a SE for percentages). However, it can be shown algebraically to apply to percentages as well.

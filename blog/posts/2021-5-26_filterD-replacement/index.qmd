Some functions illustrated below were in the `FSA` package but have now been removed and put into the non-released `FSAmisc` package that I maintain. These functions are used below **only** to show what could be done in older versions of `FSA` but should now be done as described in this post. **DO NOT USE any of the functions below that begin with `FSAmisc::`.**

We deprecated `filterD()` from FSA v0.9.0 and fully removed it by the start of 2022. `filterD()` was an attempt to streamline the process of using `filter()` (from `dplyr`) followed by `droplevels()` to remove levels of a factor variable that no longer existed in the filtered data frame.

For example, consider the very simple data frame below.

```{r}
d <- data.frame(tl=runif(6,min=100,max=200),
                spec=factor(c("LMB","LMB","SMB","BG","BG","BG")))
d
```

Now suppose that this data frame is reduced to just Bluegill.

```{r}
dbg <- d |>
  filter(spec=="BG")
```

A quick frequency table of species caught shows that levels for species that no longer exist in the data frame are maintained.

```{r}
xtabs(~spec,data=dbg)
```

This same "problem" occurs when using `subset()` from base R.

```{r}
dbg <- subset(d,spec=="BG")
xtabs(~spec,data=dbg)
```

These "problems" can be eliminated by submitting the new data frame to `drop.levels()`.

```{r}
dbg2 <- droplevels(dbg)
xtabs(~spec,data=dbg2)
```

`filterD()` was a simple work-around that eliminated this second step and was useful for helping students who were just getting started with R.

```{r}
dbg3 <- FSAmisc::filterD(d,spec=="BG")
xtabs(~spec,data=dbg3)
```

However, this was a hacky solution to a simple problem. Thus, we deprecated and subsequently removed `filterD()` from `FSA`. Thus, please use `droplevels()` (or `fct_drop()` from `forcats`) after using `filter()` to accomplish the same task of the defunct `filterD()`.

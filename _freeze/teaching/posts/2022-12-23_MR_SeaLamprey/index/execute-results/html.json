Ogle\ndate: 12/23/2022\nimage: ../../../helpers/img/exercise.png\ncategories:\n  - \"  Exercise\"\n  - \" Mark-Recapture\"\n  - \" Abundance\"\n  - \"Lamprey\"\n---\n\n\n@bergstedtetal_2003 used the Petersen (with the Chapman modification) mark-recapture method to estimate the population size of parasitic Sea Lamprey (*Petromyzon marinus*) in Lake Huron. Use their results^[Follow link in citation below.] from \"**Pre**\" period and the **1991** parasitic feeding year in **Table 3** (use the M, C, and R rows) to confirm the population estimate (in the first row of the table) and, hopefully, the confidence interval (in the second and third rows of the table). Show your work and write a formal statement about how your results compare to those in the paper.\n\n:::{.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Solution Code:\nAvailable upon request to students not in a class.

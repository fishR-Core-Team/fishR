Ogle\ndate: 3/8/2019\nimage: ../../../helpers/img/exercise.png\ncategories:\n  - \"  Exercise\"\n  - \" Age-Length Key\"\n  - \"Bass\"\n---\n\n\n# Background\n\n@wolfert_age_1980 measured the total length (TL) of 1288 [Rock Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_bass) (*Ambloplites rupestris*) from Eastern [Lake Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ontario) in the late 1970s. In addition, [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_scale) were removed for age estimation from as many as 10 specimens from each 10 mm length interval. All data are recorded in [RockBassLO2](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/reference/RockBassLO2).^[See \"CSV file\" link in \"Source\" section of linked page. Also note that the filename contains an \"oh\" not a \"zero.\"]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Construct an ALK\n\n1. Separate the observed data into age- and length-samples. How many fish are in each sample?\n1. Add a variable to the age-sample that contains the 10 mm TL categories. Construct a table of the **number** (not proportion) of fish in each age and 10 mm TL category in the age-sample. From these results, compute each of the following *by hand* (i.e., not using R, but you can use a calculator).\n    a. How many Rock Bass are in the 180 mm TL category?\n    a. How many Rock Bass are age 7?\n    a. What proportion of Rock Bass in the 140 mm TL category are age 4?\n    a. What proportion of Rock Bass in the 200 mm TL category are age 8?\n1. Construct an **observed** age-length key from the table above (using R). From these results answer the following questions.\n    a. What proportion of Rock Bass in the 210 mm TL category should be assigned age 5?\n    a. How many of thirty Rock Bass in the 180 mm TL category should be assigned age 5?\n    a. Construct a plot of the **observed** age-length key. Are there any potential anomalies in the plot that would suggest that a smoothed age-length key could be appropriate?\n1. Construct a **smoothed** age-length key. From these results answer the following questions.\n    a. What proportion of Rock Bass in the 210 mm length category should be assigned age 5?\n    a. How many of thirty Rock Bass in the 180 mm length category should be assigned age 5?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Apply an ALK I\n\nContinue with the age- and length-sample data frames and the **observed** age-length key from the previous section.\n\n5. Use the semi-random age assignment technique from @isermann_computer_2005 and the **observed** age-length key to assign ages to the unaged fish in the length-sample. Combine the age-sample and the age-assigned length-sample into a single data frame, add a variable to this data frame (or make sure that one exists) that contains the 10 mm TL categories, and use the combined data frame to answer the following questions.\n    a. How many fish are estimated to be age 5?\n    a. How many fish are estimated to be age 11?\n    a. Plot the age distribution for all fish.\n    a. How many fish are in the 150 mm TL interval?\n    a. What is the mean TL of age-5 fish?\n    a. Plot the length-at-age with the mean length-at-age superimposed for all fish.\n1. Compare your results from the previous question to someone else's results (or repeat your code and answers to the previous question). Did you both get the *exact* same results? Why or why not? If not, how different were they?\n\n:::{.callout-warning appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Save Your Script\nThe data frame with ages assigned to all fish will be used in [this growth exercise](../2019-3-8_Growth_RockBassLO/).\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Apply an ALK II\n\nContinue with the age- and length-sample data frames and the **observed** age-length key from the first section.\n\n7. Use the \"classical\" method to estimate the age distribution (with standard errors) for all sampled fish.\n    a. How many fish are estimated to be age 5?\n    a. How many fish are estimated to be age 11?\n    a. Plot the age distribution for all fish.\n1. Use the \"classical\" method to estimate the mean length-at-age (with standard deviations) for all sampled fish.\n    a. What is the mean TL of age-5 fish?\n    a. Plot the mean length-at-age.\n1. Compare your results to someone else's results (or repeat the steps above). Did you both get the *exact* same results?  Why or why not? If not, how different were they?\n1. Compare your results using the \"classical\" method here to your results from using the @isermann_computer_2005 method in the previous section.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Solution Code:\nAvailable upon request to students not in a class.

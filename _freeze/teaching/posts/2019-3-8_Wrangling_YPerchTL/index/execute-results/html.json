Ogle\ndate: 3/8/2019\nimage: ../../../helpers/img/exercise.png\ncategories:\n  - \"  Exercise\"\n  - \" Data Wrangling\"\n  - \"Yellow Perch\"\n---\n\n\nResearchers for the [North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/) program have collected fish from a number of lakes in Wisconsin since 1981. The total lengths and weights of [Yellow Perch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_perch) (*Perca flavescens*) captured from [Trout Lake](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/researchsite/trout-lake) from 1981-2006 are recorded in [YPerchTL](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/reference/YPerchTL.html).^[See \"CSV file\" link in \"Source\" section of linked page.] Use these data to answer the following questions.\n\n1. Remove the `lakeid` and `spname` variables from the data frame as these variables are constant for all records.\n1. Remove all records for which the `gearid` is \"CRAYTR\", \"FYKNED\", \"FYKNEL\", \"MINNOW\", \"TRAMML\", or any of \"VGN0XX\", as very few Yellow Perch were captured in these gears.^[It may be eaiser to look at the list of `gearid` values and keep the ones that are not listed here.] [*Use this data frame for the remaining questions.*]\n1. Create a new data frame of Yellow Perch captured in just fyke nets.\n1. Create a new data frame of Yellow Perch captured in fyke nets and beach seines.\n1. Create a new data frame of Yellow Perch captured in 1998.\n1. Create a new data frame of Yellow Perch captured after 1999.\n1. Create a new data frame of Yellow Perch captured in the 1990s.\n1. Create a new data frame of Yellow Perch captured with only fyke nets in 2005.\n1. Create a new data frame of Yellow Perch captured with only beach seines and fyke nets in 2000.\n1. Make the following changes to the data frame of Yellow Perch captured in fyke nets and beach seines in 2000.\n    a. Change the name of the `length` and `weight` variables to `tl` and `wt`, respectively.\n    a. Create a new variable that is the total length in inches.\n    a. Create two new variables that are the [common logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_logarithm) of the lengths (in mm) and weights.\n    a. Add a variable that contains 10 mm wide length categories.\n    a. Add a variable that contains the appropriate five-cell Gabelhouse length categories.\n    a. Sort the data by total length within capture year.\n\n:::{.callout-warning appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Save Your Script\nSome of these data frames will be used in this [graphing](../2019-3-8_Plotting_YPerchTL/), this [size structure](../2019-3-8_SizeStrux_YPerchTL/), and this [weight-length relationhip](../2019-3-8_WL_YPerchTL/) exercises.\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Solution Code:\nAvailable upon request to students not in a class.

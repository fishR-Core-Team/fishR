Ogle\ndate: 3/19/2022\nimage: ../../../helpers/img/exercise.png\ncategories:\n  - \"  Exercise\"\n  - \" Size Structure\"\n  - \"Yellow Perch\"\n---\n\n\nResearchers for the [North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/) program have collected fish from a number of lakes in Wisconsin since 1981. The total lengths and weights of [Yellow Perch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_perch) (*Perca flavescens*) captured from [Trout Lake](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/researchsite/trout-lake) from 1981-2006 are recorded in [YPerchTL](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/reference/YPerchTL.html).^[See \"CSV file\" link in \"Source\" section of linked page.]. Restrict these data to only fish captured in 2000. Use these data to answer the following questions.\n\n\n1. Describe the distribution of lengths for Yellow Perch captured in **fyke nets** in 1997 using both a histogram and frequency table with 10 mm length categories.\n1. Repeat the previous question with Yellow Perch captured with **beach seines**.\n1. *Statistically* compare the length frequency distributions between Yellow Perch captured with a beach seine and in fyke nets in 2000.\n1. Write a short paragraph describing what you learned about the size structure of Trout Lake Yellow Perch, with specific comments about the two gears examined.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Solution Code:\nAvailable upon request to students not in a class.

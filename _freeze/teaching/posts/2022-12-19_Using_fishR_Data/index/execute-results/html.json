Ogle\ndate: 12/19/2022\nimage: ../../../helpers/img/data.png\ncategories:\n  - \"  Data\"\n---\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nNo special packages are loaded for use in this post.\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Introduction\nA large number and variety of data sets are provided in the `FSA` and `FSAdata` packages, which I collectively call here the \"fishR data.\" Lists of the data available in these packages are available [alphabetically ordered](../../../pages/data_fishR_alpha.html) or [arranged by fisheries topic](../../../pages/data_fishR_byTopic.html).^[A more comprehensive list of fisheries data in all CRAN packages is [here](../../../pages/data_Comp_byPackage.html).] Items on those lists are linked to a documentation file where the origin of the data, its variables, and other items are described. This is a rich source of open-source data that can be used for teaching purposes.\n\nData sets in `FSA` and `FSAdata` can be, as with data in all packages, accessed with `data()` by including the name of the data as the first argument and the package name in `package=`. For example, the `WalleyeErie2` data from `FSAdata` are loaded below.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nhead(WalleyeErie2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|      setID loc grid year  tl   w  sex    mat age\n#R|  1 2003001   1  940 2003 360 460 male mature   2\n#R|  2 2003001   1  940 2003 371 571 male mature   2\n#R|  3 2003001   1  940 2003 375 507 male mature   2\n#R|  4 2003001   1  940 2003 375 584 male mature   2\n#R|  5 2003001   1  940 2003 375 537 male mature   2\n#R|  6 2003001   1  940 2003 376 553 male mature   2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile this method for accessing these data is efficient, I don't like to use it with students because in the \"real world\" they will not be accessing data from an R package, rather they will be using their own data stored in some other format. With students just learning R I usually have them load CSV files that I either provide for them or they produce themselves.^[We also discuss the advantages of CSV files -- lightweight, not proprietary, etc.] They then load the data with `read.csv()` from base R.^[For more advanced students I will use `read_csv()` from `readr`.]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Using CSV Files\nTo aid use of the fishR data as CSV files we have provided links to the raw CSV files in the R documentation,^[For example,  (e.g., try `?FSAdata::WalleyeErie2`.] in the [on-line documentation](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/reference/WalleyeErie2.html), or in the [PDF documentation on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FSAdata/FSAdata.pdf). In all instances you will see a highlighted \"CSV file\" link at the end of the description in the \"source\" section of documentation (@fig-exCSVlink). Pressing this link will bring up the raw CSV file which can then be saved to your personal computer.^[Alternatively, right-click on the CSV link to save the file.]\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Partial view of the online documentation for `WalleyeErie2` data set in `FSAdata` showing the \"CSV file\" link.](exCSVlink.png){#fig-exCSVlink fig-align='center' width=650}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nStudents can link directly to URL for the CSV file but this requires a connection to the internet (each time the data is loaded) and does not help students learn how to organize data on their own computers.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nWalleyeErie2 <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fishR-Core-Team/FSAdata/main/data-raw/WalleyeErie2.csv\")\nhead(WalleyeErie2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|      setID loc grid year  tl   w  sex    mat age\n#R|  1 2003001   1  940 2003 360 460 male mature   2\n#R|  2 2003001   1  940 2003 371 571 male mature   2\n#R|  3 2003001   1  940 2003 375 507 male mature   2\n#R|  4 2003001   1  940 2003 375 584 male mature   2\n#R|  5 2003001   1  940 2003 375 537 male mature   2\n#R|  6 2003001   1  940 2003 376 553 male mature   2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, this last example also demonstrates how an instructor could link directly to the CSV file in the resources they provide the student.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Conclusion\nIn summary, we hope you will take advantage of the data resources provided in the `FSA` and `FSAdata` packages. However, we encourage you **not** to have students access the data through `data()` but instead to use the CSV files linked to in the documentation as described above.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n",

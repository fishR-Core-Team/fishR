Ogle\ndate: 12/19/2022\nimage: ../../../helpers/img/exercise.png\ncategories:\n  - \"  Exercise\"\n  - \" Age Comparisons\"\n  - \"Whitefish\"\n---\n\n\n@herbst_comparison_2011 compared the precision, bias, and reader uncertainty of ages estimated from the [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_scale), dorsal fin rays, and [otoliths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolith) of 151 [Lake Whitefish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_whitefish) (*Coregonus clupeaformis*) captured from [Lake Champlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Champlain) in 2009. The initial age estimates from two readers and a consensus age between the two readers from each of the three structures (variables are the structure name with a “1” or “2” appended to denote the reader or “C” for the consensus age) are in [WhitefishLC](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/reference/WhitefishLC.html).^[See \"CSV file\" link in \"Source\" section of linked page.]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Version A - Otoliths\n\n1. Use tabular, graphical, and statistical methods to describe any apparent bias in age estimates from *otoliths* between the two readers.\n1. Describe precision in age estimates between the two readers for *otoliths*.\n1. Describe any apparent bias between the *consensus* age estimates from *otoliths* and *scales*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Version B - Scales\n\n1. Use tabular, graphical, and statistical methods to describe any apparent bias in age estimates from *scales* between the two readers.\n1. Describe precision in age estimates between the two readers for *scales*.\n1. Describe any apparent bias between the *consensus* age estimates from *scales* and *fin rays*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Version C - Fin Rays\n1. Use tabular, graphical, and statistical methods to describe any apparent bias in age estimates from *fin rays* between the two readers.\n1. Describe precision in age estimates between the two readers for *fin rays*.\n1. Describe any apparent bias between the *consensus* age estimates from *fin rays* and *otoliths*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Solution Code:\nAvailable upon request to students not in a class.

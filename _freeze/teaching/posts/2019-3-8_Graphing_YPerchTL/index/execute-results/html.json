Please load/run your script from that exercise to access the data frames required below.\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Describe the following from plots constructed with the Yellow Perch captured in fyke nets in 2005 data frame.\n    a. The distribution of lengths.\n    a. The distribution of weights.\n    a. The relationship between weight and length.\n    a. The relationship between the natural logs of weight and length.\n1. Describe the following from plots constructed with the Yellow Perch captured in the 1990s data frame.\n    a. The distribution of lengths separately for each gear (*without using separate data frames for each gear*).\n    a. The relationship between the natural logs of weight and length separately for each gear (*without using separate data frames for each gear*).\n    a. The difference in mean lengths among the gears (*plot should include confidence intervals*).\n    a. Describe the difference in numbers caught among the gears.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Solution Code:\nAvailable upon request to students not in a class.

Please load/run your script from that exercise to access the data frame of Yellow Perch captured in beach seines and fyke nets in 2000.\n:::\n\n1. Describe the distribution of lengths for Yellow Perch captured in **fyke nets** in 2000 using both a histogram and frequency table with 10 mm length categories.\n1. Repeat the previous question with Yellow Perch captured with **beach seines**.\n1. *Statistically* compare the length frequency distributions between Yellow Perch captured with a beach seine and in fyke nets in 2000.\n1. Write a short paragraph describing what you learned about the size structure of Trout Lake Yellow Perch, with specific comments about the two gears examined.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Solution Code:\nAvailable upon request to students not in a class.

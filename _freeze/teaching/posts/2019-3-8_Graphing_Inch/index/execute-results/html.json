Please load/run your script from that exercise to access the Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and non-game species only data frames.\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Describe the following from plots constructed with the [Bluegill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegill) only data.frame.\n    a. The distribution of lengths.\n    a. The distribution of weights.\n    a. The distribution of lengths separately for each year (*without creating separate data frames for each year*).\n    a. The relationship between weight and length.\n    a. The relationship between the natural logs of weight and length.\n    a. The relationship between the natural logs of weight and length (*without creating separate data frames for each year*).\n    a. The difference in mean lengths between the two years (*plot should include confidence intervals*).\n1. Repeat the previous question but using [Largemouth Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largemouth_bass).\n1. Describe the species distribution of (only) non-game species.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Solution Code:\nAvailable upon request to students not in a class.

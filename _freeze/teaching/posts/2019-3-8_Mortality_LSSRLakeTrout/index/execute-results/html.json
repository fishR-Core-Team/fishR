Ogle\ndate: 3/8/2019\nimage: ../../../helpers/img/exercise.png\ncategories:\n  - \"  Exercise\"\n  - \" Mortality\"\n  - \" Catch Curve\"\n  - \"Salmon/Trout\"\n---\n\n\n@curtis_1990 examined the population dynamics related to the recovery of an offshore [Lake Trout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_trout) population near [Stannard Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stannard_Rock_Light), [Lake Superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Superior). As part of this study, mortality rates were estimated from the relative abundance of Lake Trout longer than 43.2 cm. Relative abundance was recorded as the catch-per-unit-effort (CPE) of each age group in each year expressed as the number of fish caught per 50,000 m of 114.3 mm mesh gillnet. The results are shown in the table below. [Note: (1) the values in the table have been rounded to integers; (2) values recorded as \"tr\" in the original paper were recorded as \"0.5\" in this table; and (3) the years of capture are not contiguous (there is a break between 1959 and 1963 and again between 1969 and 1973).]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n| Year | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IX | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XI | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XII | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIII | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIV |\n|:----:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| 1959 | 64 | 219 | 241 | 121 | 33 | 9 | 1 | 0.5 | 1 |\n| .... | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |\n| 1963 | 129 | 339 | 331 | 192 | 70 | 16 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n| 1964 | 149 | 524 | 515 | 201 | 63 | 18 | 2 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n| 1965 | 75 | 379 | 501 | 328 | 133 | 39 | 11 | 1 | 0.5 |\n| 1966 | 149 | 488 | 459 | 172 | 64 | 22 | 5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n| 1967 | 63 | 368 | 287 | 130 | 55 | 19 | 6 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n| 1968 | 50 | 215 | 259 | 141 | 55 | 18 | 5 | 1 | 0.5 |\n| 1969 | 45 | 150 | 153 | 76 | 23 | 6 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n| .... | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |\n| 1973 | 101 | 759 | 1268 | 1116 | 491 | 141 | 40 | 4 | 0.5 |\n| 1974 | 151 | 733 | 1114 | 1092 | 571 | 163 | 50 | 9 | 5 |\n| 1975 | 109 | 901 | 1517 | 1606 | 1076 | 342 | 117 | 12 | 7 |\n| 1976 | 53 | 604 | 1204 | 1560 | 1146 | 396 | 156 | 18 | 10 |\n| 1977 | 157 | 867 | 1343 | 1410 | 1031 | 417 | 192 | 17 | 7 |\n| 1978 | 89 | 735 | 1307 | 1623 | 1150 | 445 | 198 | 18 | 14 |\n| 1979 | 29 | 299 | 718 | 1268 | 1195 | 585 | 300 | 36 | 14 |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUse these results to answer the following questions.\n  \n1.

Determine if the instantaneous mortality rate is significantly different between the earliest and latest year-classes that are fully represented for ages IX through XII.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Solution Code:\nAvailable upon request to students not in a class.

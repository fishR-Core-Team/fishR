Ogle\ndate: 3/8/2019\nimage: ../../../helpers/img/exercise.png\ncategories:\n  - \"  Exercise\"\n  - \" Mortality\"\n  - \" Catch Curve\"\n  - \"Salmon/Trout\"\n---\n\n\nThe population biology of Lake Superior [Lake Trout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_trout) (*Salvelinus namaycush*) prior to 1950 was examined in detail by @sakagawapycha_1971. In Table 1 of their paper, they presented the number of Lake Trout by age (from scales) collected in 4.5-inch mesh gillnets that were set between the [Keweenaw Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keweenaw_Peninsula) and [Munising, MI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munising,_Michigan) in 1948. The numbers of Lake Trout caught for ages 3 to 14 were 5, 18, 21, 10, 45, 109, 95, 63, 42, 25, 13, and 4. Use these data to answer the questions below. \n\n1. Is this an example of a cross-sectional or longitudinal catch curve?\n1. Plot log(catch) versus age.  Which ages best represent the descending portion of the catch curve?  Explain.\n1. Using the *unweighted* regression method, find the following (with 95% confidence intervals):\n    a. Instantaneous total mortality rate.\n    a. Annual total mortality rate.\n    a. Annual survival rate.\n1. Repeat the previous question using the *weighted* regression method.\n1. Repeat the previous question using the Chapman-Robson method.\n1. Mathematically show how to convert the instantaneous mortality rate to an annual mortality rate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n:::{.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Solution Code:\nAvailable upon request to students not in a class.

This is largely a \"thinking out loud\" exercise so I am open to suggestions you may have.\n\nThe `WhitefishLC` data frame from FSA.^[These data are loaded automatically with `library(FSA)`.] contains age readings made by two readers on scales, fin rays, and otoliths, along with consensus readings for each structure.

Below, I describe the Bland-Altman plot and then offer a modified version for comparing estimates of fish age.\n\nThe Bland-Altman plot is a scatterplot where the differences in two age estimates are on the y-axis and means of the two age estimates are on the x-axis. The plot may be augmented with several horizontal lines at the following locations (@fig-BAEx1):\n\n* Zero,\n* Mean difference in ages (heavy red dashed line),\n* Upper and lower 95% confidence limits for the mean difference in ages (dark red dashed lines),\n* Upper and lower 95% \"agreement limits\" (usually 1.96 times the standard deviation for the difference in ages above and below the mean difference in ages; heavy dashed blue lines), and\n* Upper and lower 95% confidence limits for the upper and lower \"agreement limits\" (dashed dark blue lines).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" par1='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bland-Altman plot for comparing scale to otolith age estimates of Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish. Thiw was constructed with `BlandAltmanLeh`.](index_files/figure-html/fig-BAEx1-1.png){#fig-BAEx1 fig-align='center' width=336}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs a general rule, a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference that does not contain zero suggests a difference (or a bias) between the two age estimates. For example, a bias is evident in @fig-BAEx1. In addition, one would expect 95% of the points to fall within the \"agreement limits.\" Points that fall outside this range may be considered further as possible outliers. Log differences have been used if the differences are not normally distributed and the percentage difference (where the difference is divided by the mean age) have also been used (@giavarina_understanding_2015).\n\nThe Bland-Altman plot in @fig-BAEx1 was created with `bland.altman.plot()` from the `BlandAltmanLeh` package (@lehnert_blandaltmanleh_2015). Other R functions exist for creating Bland-Altman plots (or the equivalent \"Tukey's Mean Difference Plot\"). However, I demonstrate below how to construct this plot from \"scratch.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Constructing a Bland-Altman Plot\nIn this example, a Bland-Altman plot is created to compare consensus (between two readers) scale (`scaleC`) and otolith (`otolithC`) age estimates for Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish. For simplicity, I restrict (using `select()`) the data frame below to just these two variables plus `fishID` and `tl`. In addition, for making the plot the mean and differences between the two age estimates are added the data frame (using `mutate()`).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwfSO <- WhitefishLC |>\n  select(fishID,tl,scaleC,otolithC) |>\n  mutate(meanSO=(scaleC+otolithC)/2,\n         diffSO=scaleC-otolithC)\nheadtail(wfSO)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|      fishID  tl scaleC otolithC meanSO diffSO\n#R|  1        1 345      3        3    3.0      0\n#R|  2        2 334      4        3    3.5      1\n#R|  3        3 348      6        3    4.5      3\n#R|  149    214 599     15       16   15.5     -1\n#R|  150    216 636      9       15   12.0     -6\n#R|  151    218 551      6       13    9.5     -7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA data frame of summary statistics is also needed. Below the sample, mean, standard deviation, and standard error for the differences is ages are calculated and then approximate 95% confidence limits for the differences (i.e., using the SE) and agreement limits (i.e., using the SD) are added.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsumSO <- wfSO |>\n  summarize(n=n(),\n            mean=mean(diffSO,na.rm=TRUE),\n            sd=sd(diffSO,na.rm=TRUE),\n            se=se(diffSO,na.rm=TRUE)) |>\n  mutate(lwrci=mean-1.96*se,\n         uprci=mean+1.96*se,\n         lwrag=mean-1.96*sd,\n         uprag=mean+1.96*sd)\nsumSO\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|      n      mean       sd        se     lwrci     uprci     lwrag    uprag\n#R|  1 151 -1.781457 2.553152 0.2077726 -2.188691 -1.374223 -6.785636 3.222722\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe Bland-Altman plot can then be constructed in layers using `ggplot()` (@fig-BAEx2). Horizontal lines at zero, the mean difference, confidence limits for the mean difference, and the agreement limits are added with `geom_hline()` using `yintercept=` to denoted the location of the line and varying colors (with `color=`), line widths (with `linewidth=`), and line types (with `linetype=`). `geom_point()` is then used to add the observed differences in ages at the mean age as points that are slightly transparent such that as more points are plotted on top of each other the apparent point becomes darker. Finally, labels are provided for the x- and y-axes.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=wfSO,mapping=aes(x=meanSO,y=diffSO)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color=\"gray70\",linewidth=1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=sumSO$mean,\n             color=\"red\",linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=c(sumSO$lwrci,sumSO$uprci),\n             color=\"darkred\",linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=c(sumSO$lwrag,sumSO$uprag),\n             color=\"blue\",linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_point(col=col2rgbt(\"black\",1/5),size=2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Mean Age\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Scale-Otolith Age\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bland-Altman plot for comparing scale to otolith age estimates of Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish constructed using `ggplot`.](index_files/figure-html/fig-BAEx2-1.png){#fig-BAEx2 fig-align='center' width=336}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# A Critique of the Bland-Altman Plot for Age Comparisons\nI like that Bland-Altman plots (relative to age bias plots) do not require that one of the variables be designated as the \"reference\" group. This may be more useful when comparing age estimates where one set of estimates is not clearly *a priori* considered to be more accurate (e.g., comparing readers with similar levels of experience).\n\nHowever, I don't like the following characteristics of (default) Bland-Altman plots.\n\n* There may be considerable overlap of the plotted points because of the discrete nature of most age data. Various authors have dealt with this by adding a \"petal\" to the point for each overplotted point to make a so-called \"sunflower plot\" (@lehnert_whats_2015) or using bubbles that are proportional to the number of overplotted points (@mcbride_diagnosis_2015). However, I find the \"sunflowers\" and \"bubbles\" to be distracting. I addressed this issue with transparent points above.\n* The \"agreement lines\" are not particularly useful. They may be useful for identifying outliers, but an egregious outlier will likely stand out without these lines.\n* The single confidence interval for the mean difference suggests that any bias between the sets of estimates is \"constant\" across the range of mean ages. This can be relaxed somewhat if the percentage difference is plotted on the y-axis. However, neither of these allows for more complex situations where the bias is nonlinear with age. For example, a common situation of little difference between the estimates at young ages, but increasing differences with increasing ages (e.g., @fig-BAEx2) is not well-represented by this single confidence interval.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# A Modified Bland-Altman Plot for Age Comparisons\nThe third issue above has been addressed with some Bland-Altman plots by fitting a linear regression that describes the difference in age estimates as a function of mean age (@giavarina_understanding_2015). However, this only allows for a linear relationship, which may not represent or reveal more interesting nonlinear relationships. A \"smoother\" (a loess or a generalized additive model (GAM)) could be used to estimate a \"smoothed\" potentially nonlinear relationship between the differences in ages and the means of the ages. For example, a GAM smoother is added to @fig-BAEx2 with `geom_smooth()` below.^[`geom_smooth()` defaults to a loess smoother when n<1000 points. Use `method=\"gam\"` to force using a GAM smoother. I use the GAM smoother for the hypothesis testing shown at the bottom of this section.]\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=wfSO,mapping=aes(x=meanSO,y=diffSO)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color=\"gray70\",linewidth=1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=c(sumSO$lwrci,sumSO$uprci),\n             color=\"red\",linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=c(sumSO$lwrag,sumSO$uprag),\n             color=\"blue\",linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_point(col=col2rgbt(\"black\",1/5),size=2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Mean Age\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Scale-Otolith Age\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"gam\",color=\"gray30\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bland-Altman plot for comparing scale to otolith age estimates of Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish with a loess smoother.](index_files/figure-html/fig-MBAEx1-1.png){#fig-MBAEx1 fig-align='center' width=336}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese results suggest that there is little difference between scale and otolith age estimates up to a mean age estimate of approximately five, after which age estimates from scales are less than age estimates from otoliths, with the difference between the two generally increasing with increasing mean age (@fig-MBAEx1).\n\nA similar plot is shown for the comparison of otolith age estimates between two readers in @fig-MBAEx2. Also note (see below) that the smoother term is not significant for the between-reader comparison of otolith age estimates, which suggests no relationship between the differences in ages and the mean age. In addition, the intercept term is not significantly different from zero, which indicates that there is not a constant bias between the two readers.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bland-Altman plot for comparing age estimates among two readers of Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish otoliths.](index_files/figure-html/fig-MBAEx2-1.png){#fig-MBAEx2 fig-align='center' width=336}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHypotheses about the relationship between the difference in ages and the mean age can be tested with the GAM smoother model. The first line below fits the GAM smoother model used by `geom_smooth()`. First note that `gam()` is from the `mgcv` package and is preceded by `mgcv::` so as not to load the whole package. The formula in `gam` has the difference in ages on the left side and a smoother term (denoted with the `s()` on the right side. The smoother funtion contains the mean aes and `bs=\"cs\"` (to force using the same algorithm as `geom_smoother()`). The saved object is the submitted to `summary()` to get, among other things, hypothesis test results about the significance of the smoother term.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngamSO <- mgcv::gam(diffSO~s(meanSO,bs=\"cs\"),data=wfSO)\nsummary(gamSO)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|  \n#R|  Family: gaussian \n#R|  Link function: identity \n#R|  \n#R|  Formula:\n#R|  diffSO ~ s(meanSO, bs = \"cs\")\n#R|  \n#R|  Parametric coefficients:\n#R|              Estimate Std.

This indicates that the smoother term is important to the model and that mean difference in age depends on the mean age. Thus, the difference in ages is not the same for all mean ages.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nA similar table for the comparison of otolith ages between two readers shows that the smoother term is not significant (0.958); thus, the difference in otolith ages does not depend on the mean age. In addition, the intercept term for the model is not significantly different from 0 (1.000), which along with the result about the smoother, suggests that the mean difference in ages is 0 regardless of the mean otolith age.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|  \n#R|  Family: gaussian \n#R|  Link function: identity \n#R|  \n#R|  Formula:\n#R|  diffOO ~ s(meanOO, bs = \"cs\")\n#R|  \n#R|  Parametric coefficients:\n#R|                Estimate Std.

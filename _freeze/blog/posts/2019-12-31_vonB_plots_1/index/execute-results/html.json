In this post, I briefly demonstrate how to fit a VBGF to a single group of data and then provide several options for how to view the fit of the function to those data.\n\nI will use lengths and ages of Lake Erie Walleye (*Sander vitreus*) captured during October-November, 2003-2014 available in [`FSAdata`](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/) package. These data formed many of the examples in @ogleetal_2017. My primary interest here is in the `tl` (total length in mm) and `age` variables^[See [more details about the data](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/reference/WalleyeErie2.html).]. I focus on female Walleye from location \"1\" captured in 2014 in this example.^[For succinctness, I removed `year` and `sex` as they only had one category after filtering and three variables related to the `loc`ation of capture.]\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nwf14T <- WalleyeErie2 |>\n  filter(year==2014,sex==\"female\",loc==1) |>\n  select(-year,-sex,-setID,-loc,-grid)\nheadtail(wf14T)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|       tl    w      mat age\n#R|  1   445  737 immature   2\n#R|  2   528 1571   mature   4\n#R|  3   380  506 immature   1\n#R|  323 488 1089 immature   2\n#R|  324 521 1408   mature   3\n#R|  325 565 1745   mature   3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Fitting the VBGF\nMethods for fitting a von Bertalannfy growth function (VBGF) are detailed in @ogleIntroductoryFisheriesAnalyses2016 and @ogleetal_2017. Thus, this methodology will only be briefly explained here.\n\nA function for the typical VBGF is constructed with `vbFuns()`.^[Other parameterizations of the VBGF can be used with `param=` in `vbFuns()` as described in [its documentation](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSA/reference/growthModels.html).]\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n( vb <- vbFuns(param=\"Typical\") )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|  function (t, Linf, K = NULL, t0 = NULL) \n#R|  {\n#R|      if (length(Linf) == 3) {\n#R|          K <- Linf[[2]]\n#R|          t0 <- Linf[[3]]\n#R|          Linf <- Linf[[1]]\n#R|      }\n#R|      Linf * (1 - exp(-K * (t - t0)))\n#R|  }\n#R|  <bytecode: 0x0000025568ead0f0>\n#R|  <environment: 0x0000025568ee3d40>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSome of the methods below use the fact that the three parameters of the typical VBGF ($L_{\\infty}$, $K$, $t_{0}$) can be given to this function separately (in that order) or as a vector (still in that order). For example, both lines below can be used to predict the mean length for an age-3 fish with the given VBGF parameters.^[The parameters could be given in a different order but would need to be named; e.g., `vb(3,t0=-0.5,K=0.3,Linf=300)`.]\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvb(3,300,0.3,-0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|  [1] 195.0187\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntmp <- c(300,0.3,-0.5) \nvb(3,tmp)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|  [1] 195.0187\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nReasonable starting values for the optimization algorithm may be obtained with `vbStarts()`, where the first argument is a formula of the form `lengths~ages` where `lengths` and `ages` are replaced with the actual variable names that contain the observed lengths and ages, respectively, and `data=` is set to the data frame that contains those variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n( sv0 <- vbStarts(tl~age,data=wf14T) )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|  $Linf\n#R|  [1] 645.2099\n#R|  \n#R|  $K\n#R|  [1] 0.3482598\n#R|  \n#R|  $t0\n#R|  [1] -1.548925\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `nls()` function is typically used to estimate parameters of the VBGF from observed data. The first argument is a formula that has `lengths` on the left-hand-side and the VBGF function created above on the right-hand-side. The VBGF function has the `ages` variable as its first argument and then `Linf`, `K`, and `t0` as the remaining arguments (just as they appear here).

Observed lengths and ages are added to the plot with `geom_point()`. The points in @fig-vbfit1 were made slightly larger than the default (with `size=`) and also with a fairly low transparency value to handle considerable over-plotting. `scale_y_continuous()` and `scale_x_continuous()` control aspects of y- and x-axes, respectively -- labels for axes are given in `name=`, minimum and maximum limits for the axis are in `limits=`, and specific major breaks for the axis are in `breaks=`.^[`seq(0,700,100)` makes a vector of numbers from 0 to 700 in increments of 100 and `0:11` makes a vector of integers from 0 to 11.] Finally, the fitted model line is added to the plot with `stat_function()` with the VBGF function created above in `fun=` and a list of arguments to this function in `args=`.^[The usage here exploits the fact that all three parameters of the VBGF can be given in the first parameter argument, `Linf=`.] In @fig-vbfit1 I made the model line a little wider than the default. Finally the `theme()` was modified to remove the minor grid lines from both axes.^[Thus the gridlines only appear for labelled axis breaks.]\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",\n                     limits=c(0,700),breaks=seq(0,700,100)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=coef(fit0)),linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.](index_files/figure-html/fig-vbfit1-1.png){#fig-vbfit1 fig-align='center' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe model line can be displayed outside the range of observed ages by including minimum and maximum values in `xlim=` over which the function in `fun=` will be evaluated. In @fig-vbfit1a I add a dashed line for the model that includes evaluation at ages outside the observed range of ages (first `stat_function()`) and then plotted the model line for observed ages on top of that (second `stat_function()`). This gives the impression of using a dashed line only for the ages that would be extrapolated.^[I would usually change the axis expansion factors here to clean this plot up a bit.]\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=coef(fit0)),\n                xlim=c(-1,12),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=coef(fit0)),linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.

I find it easier when using this method to first create a vector of ages over which the fitted model will be evaluated is then constructed. In this case the ages extend beyond the observed range of ages. The `seq()`uence produced here will have 101 age values between -1 and 12.^[Use a larger value for `length.out=` to make the line produced further below more smooth.]\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nages <- seq(-1,12,length.out=101)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe mean length at each of these ages is predicted with `predict()`, where the age vector just created is set equal to the name of the age variable in the `nls()` object inside of `data.frame()`. The vector of ages and predicted mean lengths are put into a data frame for plotting below.^[Here the data frame is called `preds` and it has two variables named `age` and `fit`.]\n \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npreds <- data.frame(age=ages,\n                    fit=predict(fit0,data.frame(age=ages)))\nheadtail(preds)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|        age       fit\n#R|  1   -1.00  63.17547\n#R|  2   -0.87  90.03596\n#R|  3   -0.74 115.66322\n#R|  99  11.74 642.36300\n#R|  100 11.87 642.63138\n#R|  101 12.00 642.88743\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese predicted mean lengths-at-age are then used to add a fitted model line to a plot of observed lengths-at-age with `geom_line()`. However, because the observed and predicted data are in different data frames, the `data=` and mapped `aes()`thetics are declared within the appropriate `geom`s rather than within `ggplot()`. For example, `geom_point()` is used below to add the observed data to the plot and `geom_line()` is used below to add the modeled line. Note below that separate `geom_line()`s are used to show the modeled line over extrapolated and observed ages.^[Also note the use of `filter()` to reduce the predicted lengths-at-age to the observed ages.] The results in @fig-vbfit3a reproduce @fig-vbfit1a.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl),size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  geom_line(data=preds,aes(x=age,y=fit),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data=filter(preds,age>=0,age<=11),aes(x=age,y=fit),linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.

As mentioned previously, constructing these intervals is not straightforward with non-linear models. However, confidence (or prediction) intervals can be estimated with Taylor series approximations as implemented in `predFit()` of `investr`.^[Use of `::` here allows `predFit()` from `investr` to be used without loading all of `investr`.] `predFit()` requires the saved `nls()` object as its first argument, a data frame of ages over which to make predictions as the second argument, and either `interval=\"confidence\"` for confidence intervals or `interval=\"prediction\"` for prediction intervals.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npreds <- data.frame(age=ages,\n                    investr::predFit(fit0,data.frame(age=ages),\n                                     interval=\"confidence\"))\nheadtail(preds)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n#R|        age       fit       lwr       upr\n#R|  1   -1.00  63.17547  32.40761  93.94334\n#R|  2   -0.87  90.03596  62.76575 117.30618\n#R|  3   -0.74 115.66322  91.59342 139.73301\n#R|  99  11.74 642.36300 625.59243 659.13357\n#R|  100 11.87 642.63138 625.76065 659.50210\n#R|  101 12.00 642.88743 625.91982 659.85504\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA confidence band for mean lengths at age is added to the plot with `geom_ribbon()` where the lower part of the ribbon is at the lower confidence values (i.e., `ymin=lwr`) and the upper part is at the upper confidence value (i.e., `ymax=upr`).^[Add `geom_ribbon()` first so that it is behind the points and model lines.] `fill=` gives the color of the enclosed ribbon.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() + \n  geom_ribbon(data=preds,aes(x=age,ymin=lwr,ymax=upr),fill=\"gray80\") +\n  geom_point(data=wf14T,aes(y=tl,x=age),size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  geom_line(data=preds,aes(x=age,y=fit),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data=filter(preds,age>=0,age<=11),aes(x=age,y=fit),linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014 with a 95% confidence band.

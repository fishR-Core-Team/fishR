As it turns out there are a few \"tricks\" to make a length frequency histogram appear as I expect most fisheries folks would want it to appear -- primarily, left-inclusive (i.e., 100 would be in the 100-110 bin and not the 90-100 bin). In this post, I show how to construct a length frequency histograms with `ggplot2` using my preferences.\n\nThe data are lengths of Lake Erie Walleye (*Sander vitreus*) captured during October-November, 2003-2014.^[These data are available in the [`FSAdata` package](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/index.html) and formed many of the examples in Chapter 12 of the [**Age and Growth of Fishes: Principles and Techniques book**](https://derekogle.com/AGF/).] My primary interest is in the `tl` (total length in mm), `sex`, and `loc` variables^[[See here for more details](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/reference/WalleyeErie2.html)] and I will focus on 2014 (as an example).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nWE <- dplyr::filter(WalleyeErie2,year==2014)\n```\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Basic Length Frequency\nMaking the histogram begins by identifying the data.frame to use in `data=` and the `tl` variable to use for the `x`-axis as an `aes()`thetic in `ggplot()`. The histogram is then constructed with `geom_hist()`, which I customize as follows:\n\n* Set the width of the length bins with `binwidth=`.\n* By default the bins are centered on breaks created from `binwidth=`. The bins can be changed to begin on these breaks by using `boundary=`. The value that `boundary=`, which is set to the beginning of a first break, regardless of whether that break is in the data or not. I use `boundary=0` so that bins will start on breaks that make sense relative to `binwidth=` (e.g., 0, 25, 50, 75, etc.).\n* Bins are left-exclusive and right-inclusive by default, but including `closed=\"left\"` will make the bins the desired left-inclusive and right-exclusive.\n* The fill color of the bins is set with `fill=` (I prefer a slight gray).\n* The outline color of the bins is set with `color=` (defaults to the same as `fill=`; I prefer a dark boundary to make the bins obvious).\n\nThe `scale_y_continuous()` and `scale_x_continuous()` are primarily used to provide labels (i.e., `name`s) for the y- and x-axes, respectively. By default, the bins of the histogram will \"hover\" slightly above the x-axis, which I find annoying. The `expand=` in `scale_y_continuous()` is used to expand the lower limit of the y-axis by a `mult`iple of 0 (thus, not expand the lower-limit) and expand the upper limit of the y-axis by a `mult`iple of 0.05 (thus, the upper-limit will by 5% higher than the tallest bin so that the top frame of the plot will not touch the tallest bin). Finally, `theme_bw()` gives a classic \"black-and-white\" feel to the plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlenfreq1 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 fill=\"gray80\",color=\"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that the resultant plot was assigned to an object. Thus, the object name must be run to see the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlenfreq1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/hist1a-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis base object/plot can also be modified by adding (using `+`) to it as demonstrated later.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Bins Stacked by Another Variable\nIt may be useful to see the distribution of categories of fish (e.g., sex) within the length frequency bins. To do this, move the `fill=` in `geom_histogram()` to an `aes()`thetic in `geom_histogram()` and set it equal to the variable that will identify the separation within each bin (e.g., `sex`). The bins will be stacked by this variable if `position=\"stacked\"` in `geom_histogram()` (this is the default and would not need to be explicitly set below). The fill colors for each group can be set in a number of ways, but they are set manually below with `scale_fill_manual()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlenfreq2 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(fill=sex),binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 color=\"black\",position=\"stack\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"gray80\",\"gray40\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\") +\n  theme_bw()\nlenfreq2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/hist2-1.png){width=432}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nStacked histograms are difficult to interpret in my opinion. In a future post, I will show how to use empirical density functions to examine distributions among categories. For the time being, see below.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Separated by Other Variable(s)\nA strength of `ggplot2` is that it can easily make the same plot for several different levels of another variable; e.g., separate length frequency histograms by sex. The plot can be separated into different \"facets\" with `facet_wrap()`m which takes the variable to separate by within `vars()` as the first argument.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlenfreq1 + facet_wrap(vars(sex))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/hist3a-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf the faceted groups have very different sample sizes then it may be useful to use a potentially different y-axis scale for each facet by including `scales=\"free_y\"` in `facet_wrap()`. Similarly, a potentially different scale can be used for each x-axis with `scales=\"free_x\"` or for both axes with `scales=\"free\"`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlenfreq1 + facet_wrap(vars(sex),scales=\"free_y\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/hist3b-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPlots may be faceted over multiple variables with `facet_grid()`, where the variables that identify the rows and variables for a grid of facets are included (within `vars()`) in `rows=` and `cols=`, respectively. Both scales can not be \"free\" with `facet_grid()` and the scale is only \"free\" within a row or column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlenfreq1 + facet_grid(rows=vars(loc),cols=vars(sex),scales=\"free_y\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/hist4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",

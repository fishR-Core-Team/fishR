:::{.callout-note}
The following packages are loaded for use below. I also set the default `ggplot` theme to `theme_bw()` for a classic "black-and-white" plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).
:::

```{r packages}
library(FSA)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

# Introduction



```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.show: "hide"
#| results: "hide"
# This is used as a work-around for creating a preview image. See the
#   discussion at https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/2042

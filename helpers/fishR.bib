	abstract = {Age estimates of Lake Superior Kiyis Coregonus kiyi from scales and otoliths were compared and 12 years (2003–2014) of length frequency data were examined to assess year-class strength and validate age estimates. Ages estimated from otoliths were precise and were consistently older than ages estimated from scales. Maximum otolith-derived ages were 20 years for females and 12 years for males. Age estimates showed high numbers of fish of ages 5, 6, and 11 in 2014, corresponding to the 2009, 2008, and 2003 year-classes, respectively. Strong 2003 and 2009 year-classes, along with the 2005 year-class, were also evident based on distinct modes of age-1 fish ({\textless}110 mm) in the length frequency distributions from 2004, 2010, and 2006, respectively. Modes from these year-classes were present as progressively larger fish in subsequent years. Few to no age-1 fish ({\textless}110 mm) were present in all other years. Ages estimated from otoliths were generally within 1 year of the ages corresponding to strong year-classes, at least for age-5 and older fish, suggesting that Kiyi age may be reliably estimated to within 1 year by careful examination of thin-sectioned otoliths.},

	abstract = {Pauly et al. (1992; Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 43:1151–1156) introduced a modified von Bertalanffy seasonal growth function that allowed for a period of no growth. Pauly et al. (1992) provided special purpose software to fit the model to length-at-age data, but this software is no longer available and specific details to implement a critical aspect of the new growth function were not clear. I provide details for this critical aspect of the function, implement it in the open-source R environment, and briefly demonstrate the use of this function with four data sets. With this, the growth function of Pauly et al. (1992) is now readily available to all scientists with access to software that can fit nonlinear models to data. Thus, this growth function may be implemented in more situations and its fit rigorously compared to the results from other models of fish growth.},

Errors were less than 10\% for exponents up to 4.0 if the coefficient of variation were less than 0.1, but error increased to near 90\% of actual mean weight for large exponents and coefficients of variation. Similar errors arise for other exponential relationships, such as length-fecundity, that commonly are developed in fisheries work.},

**fishR** provides resources for fisheries-related analyses performed in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), an environment for statistical analyses and graphics (see [R-project](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) or [simplilearn](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/what-is-r)) that has gained wide popularity with fisheries scientists. We hope the resources in the navigation bar above will help you use or expand your knowledge of R for fisheries-related analyses.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. The plyr package is also used but it is not loaded because I am only going to use one specific function from plyr (i.e., mapvalues()) and I have found that plyr and dplyr don’t always “play well” together.1\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)   # for mutate(), case_when()\nlibrary(forcats) # for fct_recode(), fct_collapse()\n\n \nIntroduction\nI have received a few queries recently that can be categorized as “How do I collapse a list of categories or values into a shorter list of categories or values?” For example, one user wanted to collapse species of fish into their respective families. Another user wanted to collapse years into decades. Data wrangling such as this is common in fisheries and is briefly described below.\n \nSample Data\nThe following creates a very simple sample of 250 individuals on which the species (as a short abbreviation) and year of capture were recorded. Because I am creating random example data below, I set the random number seed to make the results reproducible.\n\nset.seed(678394)  # for reproducibility of random data\nn <- 250          # to allow easily changing sample size\ndat <- data.frame(species=sample(c(\"BLG\",\"LMB\",\"PKS\",\"WAE\",\"YEP\",\"CRP\"),\n                                 n,replace=TRUE),\n                  year=sample(1980:2017,n,replace=TRUE))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year\n#R> 1     YEP 1996\n#R> 2     PKS 2005\n#R> 3     PKS 2013\n#R> 4     YEP 2014\n#R> 5     CRP 2016\n#R> 6     PKS 2006\n\n\n \nRecode Categories\nThis example demonstrates how to change the codes in one variable (e.g., species abbreviations) to new codes in another variable (e.g., long species names).\nBefore recoding I find it easier to create a vector that contains the original codes to convert from. For example, unique() extracts the vector of species abbreviations found in the species variable of the example data, which I then saved in short and alphabetized to make the next steps easier.\n\nshort <- unique(dat$species) |>\n  sort()\nshort\n\n#R> [1] \"BLG\" \"CRP\" \"LMB\" \"PKS\" \"WAE\" \"YEP\"\n\n\nIn addition, I also create a vector of codes that these codes will be converted to. For example, the long vector below contains the long-form names for each species (in the same order as the abbreviations in short)\n\nlong <- c(\"Bluegill\",\"Carp\",\"Largemouth Bass\",\n          \"Pumpkinseed\",\"Walleye\",\"Yellow Perch\")\n\nYou should “column-bind” these two vectors together to ensure that the codes align.\n\ncbind(short,long)\n\n#R>      short long             \n#R> [1,] \"BLG\" \"Bluegill\"       \n#R> [2,] \"CRP\" \"Carp\"           \n#R> [3,] \"LMB\" \"Largemouth Bass\"\n#R> [4,] \"PKS\" \"Pumpkinseed\"    \n#R> [5,] \"WAE\" \"Walleye\"        \n#R> [6,] \"YEP\" \"Yellow Perch\"\n\n\nThe mapvalues() function (from plyr) may be used to efficiently recode character (or factor) values. Because mapvalues() operates on a vector, it should be used within mutate() (from dplyr) to add a new variable with the recoded values to a data frame. Within mutate() the first argument to mapvalues() is the variable that contains the original data to be recoded. A vector of categories to code from is given in from= and a vector of new categories to code to is given in to=. For examle, the combined use of mutate() and mapvalues() below demonstrates creating a new variable in the data frame with the long species names.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(speciesL=plyr::mapvalues(species,from=short,to=long))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe use of plyr:: in front of mapvalues() ensures that mapvalues() from plyr will be used and allows for not loading the entire plyr package.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\nThis use of mapvalues() and mutate() is described in Section 2.2.7 of my book Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R.\n\n\n \nThe fct_recode() function (from forcats) can also be used to recode categories. Within mutate() the first argument to fct_recode() is the original factor variable. Subsequent arguments are of the form new level name equal to old level name.3 For example, the same recoding to long species name is shown below.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(speciesL2=fct_recode(species,\n                              \"Bluegill\" = \"BLG\",\n                              \"Carp\" = \"CRP\",\n                              \"Largemouth Bass\" = \"LMB\",\n                              \"Pumpkinseed\" = \"PKS\",\n                              \"Walleye\" = \"WAE\",\n                              \"Yellow Perch\" = \"YEP\"))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL    speciesL2\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed\n\n\n \nCollapse Categories\nIn some instances, one may want to collapse some categories into a single category (e.g., species into a family). This is easily accomplished with mapvalues() or fct_recode() by simply repeating some of the “to” categories. For example, family contains family names that correspond to the species names in the data frame. Note how multiple species have the same family name category.\n\nfam <- c(\"Centrarchidae\",\"Cyprinidae\",\"Centrarchidae\",\n         \"Centrarchidae\",\"Percidae\",\"Percidae\")\ncbind(short,long,fam)\n\n#R>      short long              fam            \n#R> [1,] \"BLG\" \"Bluegill\"        \"Centrarchidae\"\n#R> [2,] \"CRP\" \"Carp\"            \"Cyprinidae\"   \n#R> [3,] \"LMB\" \"Largemouth Bass\" \"Centrarchidae\"\n#R> [4,] \"PKS\" \"Pumpkinseed\"     \"Centrarchidae\"\n#R> [5,] \"WAE\" \"Walleye\"         \"Percidae\"     \n#R> [6,] \"YEP\" \"Yellow Perch\"    \"Percidae\"\n\n\nThe example below shows how to convert the species name abbreviations to family names. In addition, the last use of mapvalues() shows how to change the long-form names to family names. This last example is, of course, repetitive, but it is used here to demonstrate how mutate() allows a variable that was “just created” to be immediately used.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(family=plyr::mapvalues(species,from=short,to=fam),\n         family2=plyr::mapvalues(speciesL,from=long,to=fam))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n\n\nThe “collapsing” of multiple levels into one level can also be accomplished with fct_collapse() (from forcats). The first argument to this function is again the variable containing the “old” levels. Subsequent arguments are formed by setting a new level name equal to a vector containing old level names to collapse.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(family3=fct_collapse(species,\n                              \"Centarchidae\" = c(\"BLG\",\"PKS\",\"LMB\"),\n                              \"Percidae\" = c(\"WAE\",\"YEP\"),\n                              \"Cyprinidae\" = c(\"CRP\")))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R>        family3\n#R> 1     Percidae\n#R> 2 Centarchidae\n#R> 3 Centarchidae\n#R> 4     Percidae\n#R> 5   Cyprinidae\n#R> 6 Centarchidae\n\n\n \nCollapse Values into Categories\nIt is also common to categorize a numeric variable. For example, a “decade” variable is derived from the year variable in this example.\nThe case_when() function (from dplyr) may be used to efficiently collapse discrete values into categories. This function also operates on vectors and, thus, must be used with mutate() to add a variable to a data frame. The arguments to case_when() are a series of two-sided formulae where the left-side is a conditioning statement based on the original data and the right-side is the value that should appear in the new variable when that condition is TRUE. For example, the first line in case_when() below asks “if the year variable is in the values from 1980 to 1989 then the new category should be ‘1980s’.”4 For example, the code below creates a new variable called decade that identifies the decade that corresponds to the year-of-capture variable.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(decade=case_when(\n    year %in% 1980:1989 ~ \"1980s\",\n    year %in% 1990:1999 ~ \"1990s\",\n    year %in% 2000:2009 ~ \"2000s\",\n    year %in% 2010:2019 ~ \"2010s\"\n  ))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R>        family3 decade\n#R> 1     Percidae  1990s\n#R> 2 Centarchidae  2000s\n#R> 3 Centarchidae  2010s\n#R> 4     Percidae  2010s\n#R> 5   Cyprinidae  2010s\n#R> 6 Centarchidae  2000s\n\n\nThe lines in case_when() operate sequentially (like a series of “if” statements) such that the above operation can be more succinctly coded as below. Also note in this example that the resulting variable is numeric rather than categorical (simply as an example).\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(decade2=case_when(\n    year <= 1989 ~ 1980,\n    year <= 1999 ~ 1990,\n    year <= 2009 ~ 2000,\n    year <= 2019 ~ 2010,\n  ))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R>        family3 decade decade2\n#R> 1     Percidae  1990s    1990\n#R> 2 Centarchidae  2000s    2000\n#R> 3 Centarchidae  2010s    2010\n#R> 4     Percidae  2010s    2010\n#R> 5   Cyprinidae  2010s    2010\n#R> 6 Centarchidae  2000s    2000\n\nstr(dat)\n\n#R> 'data.frame':   250 obs. of  9 variables:\n#R>  $ species  : chr  \"YEP\" \"PKS\" \"PKS\" \"YEP\" ...\n#R>  $ year     : int  1996 2005 2013 2014 2016 2006 2002 2012 2013 2014 ...\n#R>  $ speciesL : chr  \"Yellow Perch\" \"Pumpkinseed\" \"Pumpkinseed\" \"Yellow Perch\" ...\n#R>  $ speciesL2: Factor w/ 6 levels \"Bluegill\",\"Carp\",..: 6 4 4 6 2 4 5 1 3 6 ...\n#R>  $ family   : chr  \"Percidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Percidae\" ...\n#R>  $ family2  : chr  \"Percidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Percidae\" ...\n#R>  $ family3  : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Centarchidae\",..: 3 1 1 3 2 1 3 1 1 3 ...\n#R>  $ decade   : chr  \"1990s\" \"2000s\" \"2010s\" \"2010s\" ...\n#R>  $ decade2  : num  1990 2000 2010 2010 2010 2000 2000 2010 2010 2010 ...\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou may be motivated from this example to use case_when() to develop a length category variable from measure lengths. While this is possible it is not efficient as you would have several conditions within case_when() (to span all measured lengths) and you would need to make sure that your conditions covered the range of measured lengths. I urge you to examine lencat() in FSA for the purpose of creating length categories (see examples here).\n\n\n \n\n\nFootnotes\n\nThis may not be a concern with recent versions of plyr and dplyr.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. I also set the default ggplot theme to theme_bw() for a classic “black-and-white” plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\n \nIntroduction\nA common graphic produced by many fisheries scientists is a length frequency histogram. As it turns out there are a few “tricks” to make a length frequency histogram appear as I expect most fisheries folks would want it to appear – primarily, left-inclusive (i.e., 100 would be in the 100-110 bin and not the 90-100 bin). In this post, I show how to construct a length frequency histograms with ggplot2 using my preferences.\nThe data are lengths of Lake Erie Walleye (Sander vitreus) captured during October-November, 2003-2014.1 My primary interest is in the tl (total length in mm), sex, and loc variables2 and I will focus on 2014 (as an example).\n\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nWE <- dplyr::filter(WalleyeErie2,year==2014)\n\n \nBasic Length Frequency\nMaking the histogram (Figure 1) begins by identifying the data frame to use in data= and the tl variable to use for the x-axis as an aes()thetic in ggplot(). The histogram is then constructed with geom_histogram(), which I customize as follows:\n\nSet the width of the length bins with binwidth=.\nBy default the bins are centered on breaks created from binwidth=. The bins can be changed to begin on these breaks by using boundary= set to the desired value of a first break, regardless of whether that break is in the data or not. I use boundary=0 so that bins will start on breaks that make sense relative to binwidth= (e.g., 0, 25, 50, 75, etc.).\nBins are left-exclusive and right-inclusive by default. Use closed=\"left\" to make the bins the desired left-inclusive and right-exclusive.\nThe fill color of the bins is set with fill= (I prefer a slight gray).\nThe outline color of the bins is set with color= (defaults to the same as fill=; I prefer a dark boundary to make the bins obvious).\n\nThe scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_continuous() are primarily used to provide labels (i.e., names) for the y- and x-axes, respectively. By default, the bins of the histogram will “hover” slightly above the x-axis, which I find annoying. The expand= in scale_y_continuous() is used to expand the lower limit of the y-axis by a multiple of 0 (thus, not expand the lower-limit) and expand the upper limit of the y-axis by a multiple of 0.05 (thus, the upper-limit will by 5% higher than the tallest bin so that the top frame of the plot will not touch the tallest bin).3\n\nlenfreq1 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 fill=\"gray80\",color=\"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\")\nlenfreq1\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Length frequency of histogram of Lake Erie Walleye, 2014.\n\n\n\n\nThis base object/plot can be modified by adding (using +) to it as demonstrated later.\n \nStacked by Other Variable\nIt may be useful to see the distribution of categories of fish (e.g., sex) within the length frequency bins (Figure 2). To do this, add fill= in the aes()thetic in ggplot() and set it equal to the variable that identifies the separation within each bin (e.g., sex). The bins will be stacked by this variable if position=\"stack\" in geom_histogram().4 The fill colors for each group can be set in a number of ways, but they are set manually below with scale_fill_manual().\n\nlenfreq2 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl,fill=sex)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 color=\"black\",position=\"stack\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"gray80\",\"gray40\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\")\nlenfreq2\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 stacked by sex.\n\n\n\n\nStacked histograms are difficult to interpret in my opinion. In a future post, I will show how to use empirical density functions to examine distributions among categories. For the time being, see below.\n \nSeparated by Other Variable(s)\nA strength of ggplot2 is that it can easily make the same plot for several different levels of another variable; e.g., separate length frequency histograms by sex (Figure 3). The plot (e.g., lenfreq from above) can be separated into different “facets” with facet_wrap(), which takes the variable to separate by within vars() as the first argument.\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_wrap(vars(sex))\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex.\n\n\n\n\nIf the faceted groups have very different sample sizes then it may be useful to use a potentially different y-axis scale for each facet by including scales=\"free_y\" in facet_wrap() (Figure 4). Similarly, a potentially different scale can be used for each x-axis with scales=\"free_x\" or for both axes with scales=\"free\".\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_wrap(vars(sex),scales=\"free_y\")\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex with different frequency scales.\n\n\n\n\nPlots may be faceted over multiple variables with facet_grid() (Figure 5), where the variables that identify the rows and variables for a grid of facets are included (within vars()) in rows= and cols=, respectively.

However, these types of plots can be more flexibly constructed using ggplot2. Below I will use ggplot2 to recreate many of the plots shown in the documentation for plot() and plotAB().\n \nData\nThe WhitefishLC data frame from FSA.1 contains age readings made by two readers on scales, fin rays, and otoliths, along with consensus readings for each structure.\n\nhead(WhitefishLC)\n\n#R>   fishID  tl scale1 scale2 scaleC finray1 finray2 finrayC otolith1 otolith2\n#R> 1      1 345      3      3      3       3       3       3        3        3\n#R> 2      2 334      4      3      4       3       3       3        3        3\n#R> 3      3 348      7      5      6       3       3       3        3        3\n#R> 4      4 300      4      3      4       3       2       3        3        3\n#R> 5      5 330      3      3      3       4       3       4        3        3\n#R> 6      6 316      4      4      4       2       3       3        6        5\n#R>   otolithC\n#R> 1        3\n#R> 2        3\n#R> 3        3\n#R> 4        3\n#R> 5        3\n#R> 6        6\n\n\nIntermediate and summary statistics for the comparison of paired ages (e.g., between consensus scale and otolith ages) can be extracted from the objected returned by ageBias() from FSA.2\n\nab1 <- ageBias(scaleC~otolithC,data=WhitefishLC,\n               ref.lab=\"Otolith Age\",nref.lab=\"Scale Age\")\n\nFor example, the $data object of ab13 contains the original paired age estimates, the differences between those two estimates, and the mean of those two estimates.\n\nhead(ab1$data)\n\n#R>   scaleC otolithC diff mean\n#R> 1      3        3    0  3.0\n#R> 2      4        3    1  3.5\n#R> 3      6        3    3  4.5\n#R> 4      4        3    1  3.5\n#R> 5      3        3    0  3.0\n#R> 6      4        6   -2  5.0\n\n\nIn addition, the $bias object of ab1 contains summary statistics of ages for the first structure given in the ageBias() formula by each age of the second structure given in that formula. For example, the first row below gives the number, minimum, maximum, mean, and standard error of the scale ages that were paired with an otolith age of 1. Additionally there is a t-test, adjusted p-value, and a significance statement for testing whether the mean scale age is different from the otolith age. Finally, confidence intervals (defaults to 95%) for the mean scale age at an otolith age of 1 is given, with a statement about whether a confidence interval could be calculated.4\n\nhead(ab1$bias)\n\n#R>   otolithC  n min max     mean        SE          t   adj.p   sig       LCI\n#R> 1        1  9   1   2 1.444444 0.1756821  2.5298218 0.28212 FALSE 1.0393208\n#R> 2        2  7   1   5 2.000000 0.5773503  0.0000000 1.00000 FALSE 0.5872748\n#R> 3        3 17   1   6 3.352941 0.2416423  1.4605937 0.81743 FALSE 2.8406824\n#R> 4        4 18   2   6 3.833333 0.2322102 -0.7177407 1.00000 FALSE 3.3434126\n#R> 5        5  8   4   8 5.250000 0.4909902  0.5091751 1.00000 FALSE 4.0889926\n#R> 6        6 10   3   6 4.600000 0.2666667 -5.2500003 0.00686  TRUE 3.9967581\n#R>        UCI canCI\n#R> 1 1.849568  TRUE\n#R> 2 3.412725  TRUE\n#R> 3 3.865200  TRUE\n#R> 4 4.323254  TRUE\n#R> 5 6.411007  TRUE\n#R> 6 5.203242  TRUE\n\n\nThe results in $bias.diff are similar to those for $bias except that the difference in age between the two structures is summarized for each otolith age.\n\nhead(ab1$bias.diff)\n\n#R>   otolithC  n min max       mean        SE          t   adj.p   sig         LCI\n#R> 1        1  9   0   1  0.4444444 0.1756821  2.5298218 0.28212 FALSE  0.03932075\n#R> 2        2  7  -1   3  0.0000000 0.5773503  0.0000000 1.00000 FALSE -1.41272519\n#R> 3        3 17  -2   3  0.3529412 0.2416423  1.4605937 0.81743 FALSE -0.15931758\n#R> 4        4 18  -2   2 -0.1666667 0.2322102 -0.7177407 1.00000 FALSE -0.65658738\n#R> 5        5  8  -1   3  0.2500000 0.4909902  0.5091751 1.00000 FALSE -0.91100742\n#R> 6        6 10  -3   0 -1.4000000 0.2666667 -5.2500003 0.00686  TRUE -2.00324188\n#R>          UCI canCI\n#R> 1  0.8495680  TRUE\n#R> 2  1.4127252  TRUE\n#R> 3  0.8652000  TRUE\n#R> 4  0.3232540  TRUE\n#R> 5  1.4110074  TRUE\n#R> 6 -0.7967581  TRUE\n\n\nThese data frames are used in ggplot2 code below to create various versions of age-bias and difference plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAt times multiple data frames will be used when constructing the same plot so that layers of the plot can have different variables.\n\n\n \nBasic Age-Bias Plot\nFigure 1 is the age-bias plot created by default by plotAB() from FSA.\n\nFSA::plotAB(ab1)\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Default age-bias plot from plotAB()\n\n\n\n\n \nFigure 1 is largely recreated (Figure 2) with the following ggplot2 code.\n\nggplot(data=ab1$bias) +\n  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),width=0) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),shape=21) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Recreation of the default age-bias plot using ggplot2\n\n\n\n\nThe specifics of the code above are described below.\n\nThe base data used in this plot is the $bias data.frame discussed above.\nThe 45o agreement line (i.e., slope of 1 and intercept of 0) is added with geom_abline(), using a dashed linetype= and a gray color=. This “layer” is first so that it sits behind the other results.\nError bars are added with geom_errorbar(). The aes()thetics here map the consensus otolith age to the x= axis and the lower and upper confidence interval values for the mean consensus scale age at each consensus otolith age to ymin= and ymax=. The color= of the lines are mapped to the sig variable so that points that are significantly different from the 45o agreement line will have a different color (with scale_color_manual() described below). Finally, width=0 assures that the error bars will not have “end caps.”\nPoints at the mean consensus scale age (y=) for each otolith age (x=) are added with geom_point(). Again, the color= and fill= are mapped to the sig variable so that they will appear different depending on whether the points are significantly different from the 45o agreement line or not. Finally, shape=21 represents a plotted point as an open circle that is outlined with color= and filled with fill=.\n\nscale_fill_manual() and scale_color_manual() are used to set the colors and fills for the levels in the sig variable. Note that guide=\"none\" is used so that a legend is not constructed for the colors and fills.\n\nscale_x_continuous() and scale_y_continuous() are used to set the labels (with name=) and axis breaks for the x- and y-axes, respectively. The names are drawn from labels that were given in the original call to ageBias() and stored in ab1.\n\nThe gridlines and the size of the fonts could be adjusted by modifying theme theme, which I did not do here for simplicity.\n \nMore Examples\nBelow are more examples of how ggplot2 can be used to recreate graphs from plot() in FSA. For example, Figure 3 is similar to Figure 2, but uses $bias.diff from ab1 to plot mean differences between scale and otolith ages against otolith ages. The reference for differences is a horizontal line at 0 so geom_abline() from above was replaced with geom_hline() here.\n\nggplot(data=ab1$bias.diff) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),width=0) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),shape=21) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,\"-\",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Age difference plot.\n\n\n\n\n \nFigure 4 is similar but it includes the raw data points from $data and colors the mean (and confidence intervals) for the differences based on the significance as in Figure 2. Because data were drawn from different data frames (i.e., ab1$data and ab1$bias.diff) the data= and aes= arguments had to be moved into the specific geom_s. Also note that the raw data were made semi-transparent (with alpha=0.1) to emphasize the over-plotting of the discrete ages.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),alpha=0.1,size=1.75) +\n  geom_errorbar(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),\n                width=0) +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),\n             shape=21,size=1.75) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=seq(0,25,1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,\"-\",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5)\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Age difference plot including points for individual observations.\n\n\n\n\n \nFigure 5 is the same as Figure 4 except that a loess smoother has been added with geom_smooth() to emphasize the trend in the differences in ages. The smoother should be fit to the raw data so be sure to use ab1$data in geom_smooth(). The smoother defaults to blue (as shown here) but I decreased the width of the line slightly with linewidth=0.65.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),alpha=0.1,size=1.75) +\n  geom_errorbar(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),\n                width=0) +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),\n             shape=21,size=1.75) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=seq(0,25,1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,\"-\",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5) +\n  geom_smooth(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),linewidth=0.65)\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Age difference plot including points for individual observations and a loess smoother.\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat Prompted This\nGraphics made in ggplot2 are more flexible than the ones produced in FSA. For example, a user recently asked if it was possible to make an “age-bias plot” that used “error bars” based on the standard deviation rather than the standard error. While it is questionable whether this is what should be plotted, it is nevertheless up to the user and their use case. Because this cannot be done using the plots in FSA we turned to ggplot to make such a graph.\nStandard deviations are not returned in any of the ageBias() results (saved in ab1). However, the standard error and sample size are returned in the $bias data frame. The standard deviation can be “back-calculated” from these two values using SD=SE*sqrt(n). Two new variables called LSD and USD that are the means minus and plus two standard deviations can then be created. All three of these variables are added to the $bias data frame using mutate() from dplyr.\n\nab1$bias <- ab1$bias %>%\n  mutate(SD=SE*sqrt(n),\n         LSD=mean-2*SD,\n         USD=mean+2*SD)\n\nA plot (Figure 6) like the very first plot above but using two standard deviations for the error bars is then created by mapping ymin= and ymax= to LSD and USD, respectively, in geom_errorbar(). Note that I removed the color related to the significance test as those don’t pertain to the results when using standard deviations to represent “error bars.”\n\nggplot(data = ab1$bias)+\n  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LSD,ymax=USD),width=0) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name =ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Mean scale age for each otolith age with error bars represented by two standard deviations.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to demonstrate the flexibility of using ggplot with these type of data, I used a violin plot to show the distribution of scale ages for each otolith age while also highlighting the mean scale age for each otolith age (Figure 7). The violin plots are created with geom_violin() using the raw data stored in $data. The group= must be set to the x-axis variable (i.e., otolith age) so that a separate violin will be constructed for each age on the x-axis. I filled the violins with grey to make them stand out more.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_violin(data=WhitefishLC,aes(x=otolithC,y=scaleC,group=otolithC),\n              fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$bias,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean),size=2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Violin plots and mean scale age at each otolith age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nThese data are loaded automatically with library(FSA).↩︎\nAs described in the documentation.↩︎\nab1 because that was the name assigned to the results from ageBias() in this example.↩︎\nSee the documentation for ageBias() for the criterion used to decide if the confidence interval can be calculated.↩︎\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{lant2021,\n  author = {Michael Lant},\n  editor = {},\n  title = {Age {Bias} {Plots} in Ggplot2},\n  date = {2021-03-15},\n  url = {https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR//blog/posts/2021-3-15-AgeBiasPlots},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMichael Lant. 2021. “Age Bias Plots in Ggplot2.” March 15,\n2021. https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR//blog/posts/2021-3-15-AgeBiasPlots."

I also set the default ggplot theme to theme_bw() for a classic “black-and-white” plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).\n\n\n\nlibrary(FSA)           # for WhitefishLC, agePrecision(), headtail()\nlibrary(dplyr)         # for arrange(), filter()\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nAn FSA user asked if there was a way to work with the age comparison results for individual fish. In particular, this user wanted to identify each fish for which the individual CV values from comparing two independent age estimates was greater than 10. This is fairly easy to do with an understanding of the results returned from agePrecision().

For example, the third value in the cumulative sum would be the sum of the first, second, and third values in the original vector. These types of cumulative sums are easily accomplished with cumsum() in base R.\n\nvec <- 1:10\n( cum <- cumsum(vec) )\n\n#R|   [1]  1  3  6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55\n\ncum[3]\n\n#R|  [1] 6\n\n\nSome applications in fisheries science (e.g., depletion estimators) require the cumulative sum NOT including the current value in the vector. For example, the third value in this case would be the sum of the first and second values in the original vector. These values may be computed by subtracting the original vector from the vector returned by cumsum().\n\ncum-vec\n\n#R|   [1]  0  1  3  6 10 15 21 28 36 45\n\n\nIn still other applications (e.g., proportional size distribution calculations) a cumulative sum from the RIGHT rather than the left is required. For example, the third value in this case would be the sum of the third, fourth, fifth, …, last values in the original vector. These values may be computed by reversing the order of the result from cumsum() that had been applied to the reverse order of the original vector.\n\nrev(cumsum(rev(vec)))\n\n#R|   [1] 55 54 52 49 45 40 34 27 19 10\n\n\n \n\n\nFSA Functions\nFor efficiency, these simple processes has been coded in pcumsum() and rcumsum() in FSA.\n\n## cumsum without the current value\n( pcum <- pcumsum(vec) )\n\n#R|   [1]  0  1  3  6 10 15 21 28 36 45\n\npcum[3]\n\n#R|  [1] 3\n\n## \"reverse\" (from the right) cumsum\n( rcum <- rcumsum(vec) )\n\n#R|   [1] 55 54 52 49 45 40 34 27 19 10\n\nrcum[3]\n\n#R|  [1] 52\n\n\nThe three types of cumulative sums are shown, along with the original vector, in the matrix below.\n\ncbind(vec,cum,pcum,rcum)\n\n#R|        vec cum pcum rcum\n#R|   [1,]   1   1    0   55\n#R|   [2,]   2   3    1   54\n#R|   [3,]   3   6    3   52\n#R|   [4,]   4  10    6   49\n#R|   [5,]   5  15   10   45\n#R|   [6,]   6  21   15   40\n#R|   [7,]   7  28   21   34\n#R|   [8,]   8  36   28   27\n#R|   [9,]   9  45   36   19\n#R|  [10,]  10  55   45   10\n\n\nThese two new functions are unlikely to change the world as we know it; however, I wanted to document them in this blog so that others could find them if needed.11 The function documentation is available here.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{h.ogle2015,\n  author = {Derek H.

    "text": "Ogle (2017) described an algorithm for implementing the “seasonal cessation in growth model” of Pauly et al. (1992). Describing an algorithm for a growth model does not seem like a useful contribution to the literature, as fitting growth models is pretty standard fare for fisheries scientists. However, fitting the Pauly et al. (1992) model is complicated by the fact that the age data is modified by model parameters. This too may not seem particularly interesting given that \\(t_0\\) in the typical von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) also modifies the age variable (i.e., age-\\(t_0\\) appears in the VBGF equation). However, the modification of age in the Pauly et al. (1992) model is a shift AND a compression of the age variable, AND the degree of shift and compression is a function of age. This is different, and more complicated, than the simple shift along the age axis in the typical VBGF.\nAs I demonstrate in my note, the Pauly et al. (1992) model has, for all practical purposes, not been used in the fisheries literature. I believe this lack of use is largely attributable to lack of clarity in how to implement the model in computer code.1 My hope is that the algorithm in my note will clarify the implementation of this model. Fisheries scientists can then rigorously test whether this model provides any advantage over other growth models with a seasonal component.1 Pauly et al. (1992) did provide a brief description of their model, but not a detailed description of how the age variable was adjusted, and computer software for fitting their model, though that software, and its source code, have long been lost.\nFull R code implementin the algorithm is available here. Implementation of the algorithm depends on the FSA package, which is available on CRAN. Please let me know what you think.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nExample fitting of the Pauly et al.

I also set the default ggplot theme to theme_bw() for a classic “black-and-white” plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).\n\n\n\nlibrary(FSA)      # for filterD(), headtail()\nlibrary(dplyr)    # for select(), arrange(), mutate(), group_by(), et al.\nlibrary(nlme)     # for nlme()\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nOne reader commented on a past post via Twitter …\n\nNow that you solved the age-bias plot, how about the ‘best’ display of back-calculated length-at-age data, with VonB growth curve overlay?\n\nIn addition, I recently received a question related to the non-convergence of a hierarchical (mixed) model applied to fitting a von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) to back-calculated lengths at age. In exploring that question, I realized that a “good” plot of back-calculated lengths-at-age was needed to understand why the VBGF may (or may not) fit.\nThis post represents my initial attempts to visualize back-calculated lengths at age with what are basically spaghetti plots. Spaghetti plots show individual longitudinal traces for each subject (e.g., one example). Recently “spaghetti plots” were in the news to show modeled paths of hurricanes (e.g., I particularly enjoyed this critique).\n \n\n\nData\nIn this post, I examine back-calculated lengths (mm) at age for Walleye (Sander vitreus) captured from Lake Mille Lacs, Minnesota in late fall (September-October).1 These data were kindly provided by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, are available in FSAData, and were used extensively in Ogle et al. (2017). For simplicity of presentation here, these data were reduced (with filter()) to a single year and sex, several unneeded variables were removed (with select(), a new factored version of the estimated age variable was created (with mutate()), and the data were ordered by estimated, fish identification number, and back-calculated age.1 More details are here.\n\n## Get data\ndata(WalleyeML,package=\"FSAdata\")\n## Wrangle data\ndf <- WalleyeML |>\n  filter(Year==2002,Sex==\"F\") |>\n  select(-Year,-Sex,-Scale.Rad,-Dist.Ann) |>\n  mutate(fEst.Age=factor(Est.Age)) |>\n  arrange(Est.Age,ID,BC.Age)\n## Examine results\nheadtail(df,n=5)\n\n#R|                 ID Est.Age  TL BC.Age BC.Len fEst.Age\n#R|  1    2002.10416.F       1 232      1  81.21        1\n#R|  2    2002.10493.F       1 248      1 114.60        1\n#R|  3    2002.10606.F       1 287      1 112.21        1\n#R|  4     2002.1153.F       1 273      1 116.29        1\n#R|  5     2002.1154.F       1 244      1 157.55        1\n#R|  1864 2002.20742.F      10 592      6 523.52       10\n#R|  1865 2002.20742.F      10 592      7 539.77       10\n#R|  1866 2002.20742.F      10 592      8 554.83       10\n#R|  1867 2002.20742.F      10 592      9 567.56       10\n#R|  1868 2002.20742.F      10 592     10 576.20       10\n\n\nThese fish were captured in late fall such that the observed length includes current year’s growth. However, the observed age does not account for time since the fish’s “birthday.” In other words, the observed age at capture should be a “fractional age” such that it represents completed years of growth plus the fraction of the current year’s growth season completed (i.e., the “current age” should be something like 10.9 rather than 10). An example of this is seen by comparing the observed length at capture (in TL) and the back-calculated length (in BC.Len) to age-1 for the first fish in the data.frame (first line in data shown above).\nSome of the plots below require a data frame where the length and age for the oldest age match in time. In other words, this data.frame should contain the length of the fish on the fish’s last “birthday.” With these data, that length is the back-calculated length at the age (in BC.Age) that matches the age of the fish at the time of capture (in Est.Age).2 An example of this data frame is below (especially compare the last five lines below to the last five lines in the previous data frame snippet above).2 With other data, that length may simply be the length of the fish at the time of capture.\n\n# data.frame of just lengths at last full age\ndf2 <- df |>\n  filter(BC.Age==Est.Age)\nheadtail(df2,n=5)\n\n#R|                ID Est.Age  TL BC.Age BC.Len fEst.Age\n#R|  1   2002.10416.F       1 232      1  81.21        1\n#R|  2   2002.10493.F       1 248      1 114.60        1\n#R|  3   2002.10606.F       1 287      1 112.21        1\n#R|  4    2002.1153.F       1 273      1 116.29        1\n#R|  5    2002.1154.F       1 244      1 157.55        1\n#R|  311 2002.20381.F      10 568     10 563.73       10\n#R|  312 2002.20483.F      10 594     10 580.81       10\n#R|  313 2002.20511.F      10 628     10 618.89       10\n#R|  314 2002.20688.F      10 620     10 611.08       10\n#R|  315 2002.20742.F      10 592     10 576.20       10\n\n\nFinally, in some plots below the mean back-calculated length at age is included.33 as.data.frame() removes the tibble class and the remaining grouping level from this data frame.\n\n# data.frame of mean lengths at back-calculated ages\ndf3 <- df |>\n  group_by(fEst.Age,BC.Age) |>\n  summarize(mnBC.Len=mean(BC.Len)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\nheadtail(df3,n=5)\n\n#R|     fEst.Age BC.Age mnBC.Len\n#R|  1         1      1 111.3464\n#R|  2         2      1 113.4633\n#R|  3         2      2 225.3060\n#R|  4         3      1  98.5338\n#R|  5         3      2 211.4096\n#R|  51       10      6 505.5437\n#R|  52       10      7 538.0147\n#R|  53       10      8 558.6757\n#R|  54       10      9 571.4900\n#R|  55       10     10 579.8577\n\n\n\n\nPlots for Exploratory Data Analysis\nWhen modeling fish growth, I explore the data to make observations about (i) variability in length at each age and (ii) “shape” of growth (i.e., whether or not there is evidence for an horizontal asymptote or inflection point). When using repeated-measures data, for example from back-calculated lengths-at-age, I observe the “shape” of growth for each individual and (iii) identify how the back-calculated lengths at age from older fish compare to the back-calculated lengths at age from younger fish.4 In this section, I describe two plots (with some augmentations to the first type) that could be useful during this exploratory stage. In the last section, I describe a plot that could be used for publication.4 As major differences could suggest “Lee’s Phenomenon”, substantial changes in growth between year-classes or over time, or problems with the back-calculation model.\n \nFigure 1 shows longitudinal traces of back-calculated lengths at age for each fish, with separate colors for fish with different observed ages at capture. From this I see variability of approximately 100 mm at each age, individual fish that generally follow the typical shape of a VBGF, and some evidence that back-calculated lengths at earlier ages from “older” fish at capture are somewhat lower than the back-calculated lengths at earlier ages for “younger” fish at capture (this is most evident with the pinkish lines).\n\nsp <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=BC.Age,y=BC.Len,color=fEst.Age,group=ID)) +\n  geom_line(alpha=1/8) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\"Back-Calculated Age\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(\"Back-Calculated Length (mm)\") +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\nsp\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Traces of back-calculated lengths at age for each fish. Traces with the same color are fish with the same observed age at capture.\n\n\n\n\n \nFigure 2 is the same as Figure 1 except that heavy lines have been added for the mean back-calculated lengths at age for fish from each age-at-capture. Here the evidence that back-calculated lengths at earlier ages from “older” fish at capture are somewhat lower than the back-calculated lengths at earlier ages for “younger” fish at capture is a little more obvious.\n\nsp +\n  geom_line(data=df3,\n            aes(x=BC.Age,y=mnBC.Len,group=fEst.Age,color=fEst.Age))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Traces of back-calculated lengths at age for each fish with mean back-calculated lengths at age shown by the heavier lines. Traces with the same color are fish with the same observed age at capture.\n\n\n\n\n \nFigure 3 is the same as Figure 1 but also has points for the length and age of each fish at the last completed year of growth. These points are most near to the observed lengths and ages at capture5 and, thus, most nearly represent the data that would be used to fit a growth model if back-calculations had not been made. With this I observe that most traces of back-calculated lengths-at-age pass near these points, which suggests that “growth” has not changed dramatically over the time represented in these data and that the model used to back-calculate lengths and ages is not dramatically incorrect.5 They will be the observed lengths and ages at capture for datasets where the fish were captured prior to when the current season’s growth had commenced.\n\nsp + \n  geom_point(data=df2,aes(color=fEst.Age),alpha=1/5)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Traces of back-calculated lengths at age for each fish. Traces with the same color are fish with the same observed age at capture.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe previous plots are cluttered because of the number of individual fish. This clutter can be somewhat reduced by creating separate spaghetti plots for each observed age at capture (Figure 4). From this, I observe the clear start of an asymptote at about age 5, an indication of a slight inflection around age 2 (most evident for fish that were older at capture), and that a good portion of the variability in length at early ages may be attributable to fish from different year-classes (i.e., of different observed ages-at-capture). It is, however, more difficult to see that back-calculated lengths at earlier ages from “older” fish at capture are somewhat lower than the back-calculated lengths at earlier ages for “younger” fish at capture.66 I left the facet for age-1 fish in this plot to remind me that there were age-1 fish in these data, even though they do not show a trace. Also, the color here is superfluous and could be removed. I left the color here for comparison with previous figures.\n\n## Make facet labels for the plot below\nlbls <- paste(\"Age =\",levels(df$fEst.Age))\nnames(lbls) <- levels(df$fEst.Age)\n\n## Spaghetti plot separated by age at capture (with means)\nsp + \n  facet_wrap(~fEst.Age,labeller=labeller(fEst.Age=lbls)) +\n  geom_line(data=df3,aes(x=BC.Age,y=mnBC.Len,group=1),color=\"black\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Traces of back-calculated lengths at age for each fish separated by observed age at capture. Black lines in each facet are the mean back-calculated lengths at age for fish shown in that facet.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPublication Graphic with Model Overlaid\nFor publication I would include traces for individual fish, but without color coding by estimated age-at-capture, and overlay the population-average growth model (i.e., the growth model expressed from using the “fixed effects” for each model parameter; Figure 5).77 The model fitting code below is from Ogle et al.

I will use the PSalmonAK data used in the book (Ogle 2016) and available in FSAdata.1 As in the book, I remove all records with missing stock (escapement) or recruit (return) data, rescale both the escapement and return variables to be 1000s of 1000s of fish (so millions of fish), create a log of returns variable (logret), create “recruits per spawner” (retperesc) and log recruits per spawner (logretperesc) variables, and, for convenience, remove the harvest and SST variables.1 Also documented here.\n\ndata(PSalmonAK,package=\"FSAdata\")\npinks <- PSalmonAK |>\n  filter(!is.na(escapement),!is.na(return)) |>\n  mutate(escapement=escapement/1000,return=return/1000,\n         logret=log(return),\n         retperesc=return/escapement,logretperesc=log(retperesc)) |>\n  select(-harvest,-SST)\nheadtail(pinks)\n\n#R|     year escapement return   logret retperesc logretperesc\n#R|  1  1960      1.418  2.446 0.894454  1.724965    0.5452066\n#R|  2  1961      2.835 14.934 2.703640  5.267725    1.6615986\n#R|  3  1962      1.957 10.031 2.305680  5.125703    1.6342676\n#R|  28 1987      4.289 18.215 2.902245  4.246911    1.4461918\n#R|  29 1988      2.892  9.461 2.247178  3.271438    1.1852298\n#R|  30 1989      4.577 23.359 3.150982  5.103561    1.6299386\n\n\n \n\n\nDynamic Plot Issue\nSince Ogle (2016) was published the dynamicPlot= argument was removed from srStarts() in FSA because the code for that argument relied on the tcltk package, which I found difficult to reliably support. A similar, though more manual, approach is accomplished with the new fixed= and plot= arguments. For example, using plot=TRUE (without fixed=) generates a plot of “recruits” versus “stock” with the chosen stock-recruitment model evaluated at the automatically chosen parameter starting values superimposed.\n\nsvR <- srStarts(return~escapement,data=pinks,type=\"Ricker\",plot=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Recruitment versus stock plot with the Ricker function evaluated at the automatically chosen starting values superimposed.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe user, however, can show the stock-recruitment model evaluated at manually chosen parameter starting values by including those starting values in a named list() supplied to fixed=. These values can be iteratively changed in subsequent calls to srStarts() to manually find starting values that provide a model that reasonably fits (by eye) the stock-recruit data.\n\nsvR <- srStarts(return~escapement,data=pinks,type=\"Ricker\",plot=TRUE,\n                fixed=list(a=4,b=0.15))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Recruitment versus stock plot with the Ricker function evaluated at the manually chosen starting values superimposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nsrStarts() no longer, however, supports the simultaneously plotting of spawners versus recruits and recruits per spawner versus recruits.\n\n\n \n\n\nPlot of Recruits per Spawner versus Spawners\nThe first way that I imagined plotting recruits per spawners versus spawners with the fitted curve and confidence bands is to first follow the code for fitting the stock-recruit function to the stock and recruit data as described in Ogle (2016). In this case, the stock-recruit function is fit on the log scale to adjust for a multiplicative error structure (as described in the book).22 The manually selected starting values from above are used here.\n\nrckr <- srFuns(\"Ricker\")\nsrR <- nls(logret~log(rckr(escapement,a,b)),data=pinks,start=svR)\nbootR <- nlsBoot(srR)\ncbind(estimates=coef(srR),confint(bootR))\n\n#R|     estimates     95% LCI   95% UCI\n#R|  a 2.84924199  1.70935506 4.6711392\n#R|  b 0.05516673 -0.08391462 0.1994054\n\n\nOgle (2016) showed how to plot spawners versus recruits using base graphics. Here however I will use ggplot2. Either method first requires (i) constructing a sequence of “x” values that span the range of observed numbers of spawners,3 (ii) predicting the number of recruits at each spawner value using the best-fit stock-recruitment model, and (iii) constructing lower and upper confidence bounds for the predicted number of recruits at each spawner value with the bootstrap results. These results are assigned to a data framed called preds below.3 Increase the value in length.out= for a smoother curve and band.\n\nx <- seq(0,9,length.out=199)        # many S for prediction\npR <- rckr(x,a=coef(srR))           # predicted mean R\nLCI <- UCI <- numeric(length(x))\n\nfor(i in 1:length(x)) {             # CIs for mean R @ each S\n  tmp <- apply(bootR$coefboot,MARGIN=1,FUN=rckr,S=x[i])\n  LCI[i] <- quantile(tmp,0.025)\n  UCI[i] <- quantile(tmp,0.975)\n}\npreds <- data.frame(escapement=x,return=pR,LCI=LCI,UCI=UCI)\nheadtail(preds)\n\n#R|      escapement     return        LCI        UCI\n#R|  1   0.00000000  0.0000000 0.00000000  0.0000000\n#R|  2   0.04545455  0.1291866 0.07794713  0.2103041\n#R|  3   0.09090909  0.2577262 0.15650236  0.4166059\n#R|  197 8.90909091 15.5279219 6.50772063 34.9827333\n#R|  198 8.95454545 15.5680589 6.48296004 35.2738317\n#R|  199 9.00000000 15.6078974 6.45812729 35.5664363\n\n\n \nThe recruits versus spawners graph is then constructed in ggplot2 by adding the 95% confidence band from preds using geom_ribbon(), adding the best-fit model curve from preds using geom_line(), and adding the observed data from pinks using geom_point().44 I plot the layers in this order so that the line is on top of the confidence band and the points are on top of both the line and band.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_ribbon(data=preds,mapping=aes(x=escapement,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI),\n              fill=\"gray50\",alpha=0.5) +\n  geom_line(data=preds,mapping=aes(x=escapement,y=return),linewidth=1) +\n  geom_point(data=pinks,mapping=aes(x=escapement,y=return)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Escapement (millions)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Returners (millions)\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Returners versus escapement for Pacific Salmon with the best-fit Ricker recruitment function and bootstrapped 95% confidence band.\n\n\n\n\n \nThese results can be modified to plot recruits per spawner versus spawners by replacing the “recruits” in the code above with “recruits per spawner.” This is simple for the observed data as return is simply replaced with retperesc. However, the predicted number of recruits (return in preds) and the confidence bounds (LCI and UCI in preds) from above must be divided by the number of spawners (escapement in preds). The preds data frame is modified accordingly below.\n\npreds <- preds |>\n  mutate(retperesc=return/escapement,\n         rpeLCI=LCI/escapement,\n         rpeUCI=UCI/escapement)\n\nThe plot is then constructed with the appropriate modification of variable names and axis labels.55 I used red for the confidence band here for illustrative purposes below, usually I would use a gray as in Figure 3.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_ribbon(data=preds,mapping=aes(x=escapement,ymin=rpeLCI,ymax=rpeUCI),\n              fill=\"red\",alpha=0.5) +\n  geom_line(data=preds,mapping=aes(x=escapement,y=retperesc),linewidth=1) +\n  geom_point(data=pinks,mapping=aes(x=escapement,y=retperesc)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Escapement (millions)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Returners/Escapement\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Returners per escapement versus escapement for Pacific Salmon with the best-fit Ricker recruitment function and bootstrapped 95% confidence band.\n\n\n\n\n \nAlternatively, the Ricker model could be reparameterized by dividing each side of the function by “spawners” such that the left-hand-side becomes “recruits per spawner.”6 This recruitment model can be put into an R function, with parameters estimated with nonlinear regression similar to above. The results below show that the parameter point estimates are identical and the bootsrapped confidence intervals are similar to what was obtained above.6 This is a fairly typical reparameterization of the Ricker model.\n\nrckr2 <- function(S,a,b=NULL) {\n  if (length(a)>1) { b <- a[[2]]; a <- a[[1]] }\n  a*exp(-b*S)\n}\nsrR2 <- nls(logretperesc~log(rckr2(escapement,a,b)),data=pinks,start=svR)\nbootR2 <- nlsBoot(srR2)\ncbind(estimates=coef(srR2),confint(bootR2))\n\n#R|     estimates     95% LCI   95% UCI\n#R|  a 2.84924192  1.67775104 4.9025369\n#R|  b 0.05516672 -0.08979965 0.2103898\n\n\nWith this, a second method for plotting recruits per spawner versus spawners is the same as how the main plot from the book was constructed but modified to use the results from this reparameterized function.\n\nx <- seq(0,9,length.out=199)        # many S for prediction\npRperS <- rckr2(x,a=coef(srR2))     # predicted mean RperS\nLCI2 <- UCI2 <- numeric(length(x))\n\nfor(i in 1:length(x)) {             # CIs for mean RperS @ each S\n  tmp <- apply(bootR2$coefboot,MARGIN=1,FUN=rckr2,S=x[i])\n  LCI2[i] <- quantile(tmp,0.025)\n  UCI2[i] <- quantile(tmp,0.975)\n}\npreds2 <- data.frame(escapement=x,retperesc=pRperS,rpeLCI=LCI2,rpeUCI=UCI2)\nheadtail(preds2)\n\n#R|      escapement retperesc    rpeLCI   rpeUCI\n#R|  1   0.00000000  2.849242 1.6777510 4.902537\n#R|  2   0.04545455  2.842106 1.6841248 4.846330\n#R|  3   0.09090909  2.834988 1.6905230 4.796657\n#R|  197 8.90909091  1.742930 0.6884826 4.213108\n#R|  198 8.95454545  1.738565 0.6821556 4.229946\n#R|  199 9.00000000  1.734211 0.6758867 4.246851\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_ribbon(data=preds2,mapping=aes(x=escapement,ymin=rpeLCI,ymax=rpeUCI),\n              fill=\"blue\",alpha=0.5) +\n  geom_line(data=preds2,mapping=aes(x=escapement,y=retperesc),linewidth=1) +\n  geom_point(data=pinks,mapping=aes(x=escapement,y=retperesc)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Escapement (millions)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Returners/Escapement\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Returners per escapement versus escapement for Pacific Salmon with the best-fit Ricker recruitment function and bootstrapped 95% confidence band.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe two methods described above for plotting recruits per spawner versuse spawners are identical for the best-fit curve and nearly identical for the confidence bounds (slight differences likely due to the randomness inherent in bootstrapping).

McBride (2015) used the Bland-Altman plot in his simulation study of the effects of accuracy and precision on the ability to diagnose agreement between sets of fish age estimates. McBride (2015) noted that Bland-Altman plots “readily depict both bias and imprecision” and that this was summarized for “the entire sample, rather than specific age classes.” Despite this, I am aware of only two entries in the fisheries literature that used the Bland-Altman plot to compare fish age estimates (one in the grey literature, one in a thesis). Below, I describe the Bland-Altman plot and then offer a modified version for comparing estimates of fish age.\nThe Bland-Altman plot is a scatterplot where the differences in two age estimates are on the y-axis and means of the two age estimates are on the x-axis. The plot may be augmented with several horizontal lines at the following locations (Figure 1):\n\nZero,\nMean difference in ages (heavy red dashed line),\nUpper and lower 95% confidence limits for the mean difference in ages (dark red dashed lines),\nUpper and lower 95% “agreement limits” (usually 1.96 times the standard deviation for the difference in ages above and below the mean difference in ages; heavy dashed blue lines), and\nUpper and lower 95% confidence limits for the upper and lower “agreement limits” (dashed dark blue lines).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bland-Altman plot for comparing scale to otolith age estimates of Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish. Thiw was constructed with BlandAltmanLeh.\n\n\n\n\n \nAs a general rule, a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference that does not contain zero suggests a difference (or a bias) between the two age estimates. For example, a bias is evident in Figure 1. In addition, one would expect 95% of the points to fall within the “agreement limits.” Points that fall outside this range may be considered further as possible outliers. Log differences have been used if the differences are not normally distributed and the percentage difference (where the difference is divided by the mean age) have also been used (Giavarina 2015).\nThe Bland-Altman plot in Figure 1 was created with bland.altman.plot() from the BlandAltmanLeh package (Lehnert 2015b). Other R functions exist for creating Bland-Altman plots (or the equivalent “Tukey’s Mean Difference Plot”). However, I demonstrate below how to construct this plot from “scratch.”\n \n\n\nConstructing a Bland-Altman Plot\nIn this example, a Bland-Altman plot is created to compare consensus (between two readers) scale (scaleC) and otolith (otolithC) age estimates for Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish. For simplicity, I restrict (using select()) the data frame below to just these two variables plus fishID and tl. In addition, for making the plot the mean and differences between the two age estimates are added the data frame (using mutate()).\n\nwfSO <- WhitefishLC |>\n  select(fishID,tl,scaleC,otolithC) |>\n  mutate(meanSO=(scaleC+otolithC)/2,\n         diffSO=scaleC-otolithC)\nheadtail(wfSO)\n\n#R|      fishID  tl scaleC otolithC meanSO diffSO\n#R|  1        1 345      3        3    3.0      0\n#R|  2        2 334      4        3    3.5      1\n#R|  3        3 348      6        3    4.5      3\n#R|  149    214 599     15       16   15.5     -1\n#R|  150    216 636      9       15   12.0     -6\n#R|  151    218 551      6       13    9.5     -7\n\n\nA data frame of summary statistics is also needed. Below the sample, mean, standard deviation, and standard error for the differences is ages are calculated and then approximate 95% confidence limits for the differences (i.e., using the SE) and agreement limits (i.e., using the SD) are added.\n\nsumSO <- wfSO |>\n  summarize(n=n(),\n            mean=mean(diffSO,na.rm=TRUE),\n            sd=sd(diffSO,na.rm=TRUE),\n            se=se(diffSO,na.rm=TRUE)) |>\n  mutate(lwrci=mean-1.96*se,\n         uprci=mean+1.96*se,\n         lwrag=mean-1.96*sd,\n         uprag=mean+1.96*sd)\nsumSO\n\n#R|      n      mean       sd        se     lwrci     uprci     lwrag    uprag\n#R|  1 151 -1.781457 2.553152 0.2077726 -2.188691 -1.374223 -6.785636 3.222722\n\n\nThe Bland-Altman plot can then be constructed in layers using ggplot() (Figure 2). Horizontal lines at zero, the mean difference, confidence limits for the mean difference, and the agreement limits are added with geom_hline() using yintercept= to denoted the location of the line and varying colors (with color=), line widths (with linewidth=), and line types (with linetype=). geom_point() is then used to add the observed differences in ages at the mean age as points that are slightly transparent such that as more points are plotted on top of each other the apparent point becomes darker. Finally, labels are provided for the x- and y-axes.\n\nggplot(data=wfSO,mapping=aes(x=meanSO,y=diffSO)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color=\"gray70\",linewidth=1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=sumSO$mean,\n             color=\"red\",linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=c(sumSO$lwrci,sumSO$uprci),\n             color=\"darkred\",linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=c(sumSO$lwrag,sumSO$uprag),\n             color=\"blue\",linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_point(col=col2rgbt(\"black\",1/5),size=2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Mean Age\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Scale-Otolith Age\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bland-Altman plot for comparing scale to otolith age estimates of Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish constructed using ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA Critique of the Bland-Altman Plot for Age Comparisons\nI like that Bland-Altman plots (relative to age bias plots) do not require that one of the variables be designated as the “reference” group. This may be more useful when comparing age estimates where one set of estimates is not clearly a priori considered to be more accurate (e.g., comparing readers with similar levels of experience).\nHowever, I don’t like the following characteristics of (default) Bland-Altman plots.\n\nThere may be considerable overlap of the plotted points because of the discrete nature of most age data. Various authors have dealt with this by adding a “petal” to the point for each overplotted point to make a so-called “sunflower plot” (Lehnert 2015a) or using bubbles that are proportional to the number of overplotted points (McBride 2015). However, I find the “sunflowers” and “bubbles” to be distracting. I addressed this issue with transparent points above.\nThe “agreement lines” are not particularly useful. They may be useful for identifying outliers, but an egregious outlier will likely stand out without these lines.\nThe single confidence interval for the mean difference suggests that any bias between the sets of estimates is “constant” across the range of mean ages. This can be relaxed somewhat if the percentage difference is plotted on the y-axis. However, neither of these allows for more complex situations where the bias is nonlinear with age. For example, a common situation of little difference between the estimates at young ages, but increasing differences with increasing ages (e.g., Figure 2) is not well-represented by this single confidence interval.\n\n \n\n\nA Modified Bland-Altman Plot for Age Comparisons\nThe third issue above has been addressed with some Bland-Altman plots by fitting a linear regression that describes the difference in age estimates as a function of mean age (Giavarina 2015). However, this only allows for a linear relationship, which may not represent or reveal more interesting nonlinear relationships. A “smoother” (a loess or a generalized additive model (GAM)) could be used to estimate a “smoothed” potentially nonlinear relationship between the differences in ages and the means of the ages. For example, a GAM smoother is added to Figure 2 with geom_smooth() below.22 geom_smooth() defaults to a loess smoother when n<1000 points. Use method=\"gam\" to force using a GAM smoother. I use the GAM smoother for the hypothesis testing shown at the bottom of this section.\n\nggplot(data=wfSO,mapping=aes(x=meanSO,y=diffSO)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color=\"gray70\",linewidth=1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=c(sumSO$lwrci,sumSO$uprci),\n             color=\"red\",linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=c(sumSO$lwrag,sumSO$uprag),\n             color=\"blue\",linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_point(col=col2rgbt(\"black\",1/5),size=2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Mean Age\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Scale-Otolith Age\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"gam\",color=\"gray30\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bland-Altman plot for comparing scale to otolith age estimates of Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish with a loess smoother.\n\n\n\n\nThese results suggest that there is little difference between scale and otolith age estimates up to a mean age estimate of approximately five, after which age estimates from scales are less than age estimates from otoliths, with the difference between the two generally increasing with increasing mean age (Figure 3).\nA similar plot is shown for the comparison of otolith age estimates between two readers in Figure 4. Also note (see below) that the smoother term is not significant for the between-reader comparison of otolith age estimates, which suggests no relationship between the differences in ages and the mean age. In addition, the intercept term is not significantly different from zero, which indicates that there is not a constant bias between the two readers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Bland-Altman plot for comparing age estimates among two readers of Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish otoliths.\n\n\n\n\n \nHypotheses about the relationship between the difference in ages and the mean age can be tested with the GAM smoother model. The first line below fits the GAM smoother model used by geom_smooth(). First note that gam() is from the mgcv package and is preceded by mgcv:: so as not to load the whole package. The formula in gam has the difference in ages on the left side and a smoother term (denoted with the s() on the right side. The smoother funtion contains the mean aes and bs=\"cs\" (to force using the same algorithm as geom_smoother()). The saved object is the submitted to summary() to get, among other things, hypothesis test results about the significance of the smoother term.\n\ngamSO <- mgcv::gam(diffSO~s(meanSO,bs=\"cs\"),data=wfSO)\nsummary(gamSO)\n\n#R|  \n#R|  Family: gaussian \n#R|  Link function: identity \n#R|  \n#R|  Formula:\n#R|  diffSO ~ s(meanSO, bs = \"cs\")\n#R|  \n#R|  Parametric coefficients:\n#R|              Estimate Std.

This indicates that the smoother term is important to the model and that mean difference in age depends on the mean age. Thus, the difference in ages is not the same for all mean ages.\n\n\n\nA similar table for the comparison of otolith ages between two readers shows that the smoother term is not significant (0.958); thus, the difference in otolith ages does not depend on the mean age. In addition, the intercept term for the model is not significantly different from 0 (1.000), which along with the result about the smoother, suggests that the mean difference in ages is 0 regardless of the mean otolith age.\n\n\n#R|  \n#R|  Family: gaussian \n#R|  Link function: identity \n#R|  \n#R|  Formula:\n#R|  diffOO ~ s(meanOO, bs = \"cs\")\n#R|  \n#R|  Parametric coefficients:\n#R|                Estimate Std.

A weight-length relationship was available (derived from a smaller sample from the same population). A question arose about whether the weight-length relationship should be used to predict weights for individual fish and then summarized to estimate mean weights at age or whether the weight-length relationship should be applied to summarized mean lengths-at-age to estimate mean weights-at-age.\nThis issue has been addressed in the literature. Ricker (1975) states that the true mean weight is always greater, “on the order of 5%,” than the mean weight computed from the weight-length relationship with the mean length. Tesch (1971) suggested that the error in predicting mean weight-at-age with the weight-length relationship using mean length-at-age would be about 5-10%. In a simulation study, Nielsen and Schoch (1980) found that Tesch’s suggestion was too general and that error was less than 10% when the coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation divided by mean) in lengths was less than 10%, but could be substantially higher when the CV was higher, with the specific result dependent on the weight-length regression exponent (b).1 Pienaar and Ricker (1968) and Beyer (1991) both suggested corrections to reduce the bias in the mean weight-at-age produced by the weight-length regression using the mean length.1 Nielsen and Schoch (1980) provided a nice geometric description of why this bias occurs.\nIn this post, I explore the bias in using the weight-length regression to estimate mean weight-at-age from mean length-at-age and the correction factors suggested by Beyer (1991).\n \n\n\nSample Data\nI created a very simple population that consisted of lengths, weights, and ages of fish. Ages were derived from a population with roughly a 30% annual mortality rate. Mean lengths-at-age were modeled with a von Bertalanffy growth curve using a \\(L_{\\infty}\\)=650 mm, \\(K\\)=0.3, and \\(t_{0}\\)=0. Individual lengths were modeled from normal distributions using the modeled mean length and a constant standard deviation of 30 mm) within each age-class. Weights were predicted directly from a known weight-length relationship without any error (in wt1) and with a small amount of error (in wt2).\n\n# Generate some lengths\nages <- 3:8\nN3 <- 100      ## number at age-3\nA <- 0.3       ## annual morality rate\nns <- round(N3*(1-A)^(ages-min(ages)),0)  ## numbers at age\nLinf <- 650    ## von B parameters\nK <- 0.3\nt0 <- 0\nmns <- Linf*(1-exp(-K*(ages-t0)))         ## mean length-at-age\nsds <- rep(30,length(mns))\nlens <- NULL\nfor (i in 1:length(ages))                 ## individual lengths-at-age\n  lens <- c(lens,rnorm(ns[i],mean=mns[i],sd=sds[i]))\nloga <- -13.5  ## weight-length relationship parameters\nb <- 3.2\n# Compute weights from the W-L relationship, w/ & w/o error\ndf <- data.frame(age=rep(ages,ns),len=round(lens,0)) |>\n  mutate(wt1=round(exp(loga+b*log(len)),0),\n         wt2=round(exp(loga+b*log(len)+rnorm(length(lens),mean=0,sd=0.1)),0))\nheadtail(df)\n\n#R|      age len  wt1  wt2\n#R|  1     3 374  235  197\n#R|  2     3 401  293  313\n#R|  3     3 369  225  210\n#R|  292   8 580  955  923\n#R|  293   8 605 1093 1081\n#R|  294   8 589 1003 1126\n\n\nModeling data in this way is simple, but at least somewhat realistic (Figure 1).\n\nlenh <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=len)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=10,boundary=0,color=\"black\",fill=\"gray70\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Length (mm)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"frequency\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05)))\nlenw <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=wt2)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,color=\"black\",fill=\"gray70\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Weight (g)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"frequency\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05)))\nwl <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=len,y=wt2)) +\n  geom_point(pch=21,fill=\"gray70\",color=\"black\")  +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Length (mm)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Weight (g)\")\nal <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=age,y=len)) +\n  geom_jitter(pch=21,fill=\"gray70\",color=\"black\",width=0.05,height=0)  +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Length (mm)\")\n(lenh + lenw) / (wl + al)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Histograms of lengths (upper left) and weights (upper right) and scatterplots of weight versus length (lower left) and length versus age (lower right).\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExplore the Bias\nBelow the mean length (mnlen) and mean weight without any random erro (i.e., the “true” mean weight for individuals modeled above; true.mnwt) are calculated (using group_by() and summarize()). The predicted mean weight at each age is then computed from the mean length at each age and the weight-length relationship (i.e., pr.mnwt using mutate() and the regression coefficient values from above). Finally a percentage error between the predicted and true mean weights is computed for each age (in dif.minwt).22 The as.data.frame() is used here because I don’t like the tibble format that is returned by summarize().\n\nsum1 <- group_by(df,age) |>\n  summarize(mnlen=mean(len),\n            true.mnwt=mean(wt1)) |>\n  mutate(pr.mnwt=exp(loga+b*log(mnlen)),\n         dif.mnwt=(pr.mnwt-true.mnwt)/true.mnwt*100) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\nThe results from this one sample show that the mean weights computed from the mean lengths and the weight-length regression (i.e., pr.mnwt) are lower at each age then the “true” mean weights (true.mnwt; Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage\nmnlen\ntrue.mnwt\npr.mnwt\ndif.mnwt\n\n\n\n\n3\n391\n276\n270\n-2.15\n\n\n4\n454\n448\n438\n-2.23\n\n\n5\n511\n644\n636\n-1.29\n\n\n6\n550\n817\n806\n-1.35\n\n\n7\n570\n912\n906\n-0.72\n\n\n8\n594\n1034\n1028\n-0.58\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary table using weights without any error and no correction for the predicted mean weights.\n\n\n \nOf course, weight-length relationships are not without error, so the weights with a small amount of random error were used to determine if the pattern of a negative bias when predicting mean weights from mean lengths persists with more realistic data.3 Results from this one set of more realistic data showed a similar, though not as consistent, degree of negative bias when predicting mean weights from mean lengths (Table 2).3 Only a small error was added because the relationship between weight and length is very strong for most fishes. The r-squared for this relationship was a realistic 0.969.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage\nmnlen\ntrue.mnwt\npr.mnwt\ndif.mnwt\n\n\n\n\n3\n391\n277\n270\n-2.55\n\n\n4\n454\n448\n438\n-2.24\n\n\n5\n511\n643\n636\n-1.12\n\n\n6\n550\n830\n806\n-2.87\n\n\n7\n570\n906\n906\n-0.02\n\n\n8\n594\n1054\n1028\n-2.50\n\n\n\nTable 2: Summary table using weights with a small amount of error and no correction for the predicted mean weights.\n\n\n \nI then performed the analysis above 1000 times, keeping track of the percent error between the predicted weight and the true mean weight for each age for each sample.44 The code here also uses the correction factors discussed above; those results are presented further below.\n\n\n\nThe results of this simulation suggest an average negative bias near 4% for age-3 fish and between about 1 and 2% for all older fish (Table 3). Note that the CV in length for each age varied between 2.7% and 9.8% in these simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage3\nage4\nage5\nage6\nage7\nage8\n\n\n\n\n-2.49\n-1.97\n-1.74\n-1.5\n-1.32\n-1.39\n\n\n\nTable 3: Mean percentage difference in uncorrected predicted mean and true mean weights by age class for 1000 simulations.\n\n\n \nSimilar patterns were found using different values of the weight-length relationship exponent \\(b\\) (see Appendix). However, larger negative biases were observed as the standard deviation in lengths increased (see Appendix).\n\n\nA Possible Correction\nAs noted above, Pienaar and Ricker (1968) and Beyer (1991) offered methods to reduce or eliminate the bias from using the weight-length regression to estimate mean weight-at-age from mean length-at-age. Beyer’s corrections were simple as they were based on the CV of lengths and the \\(b\\) coefficient from the weight-length regression. Beyer specifically offered three possible bias correcting factors for isometric growth, allometric growth assuming a lognormal distribution, and allometric growth assuming a normal distributions for lengths. Here I will only consider Beyer’s corrections for allometric growth with lognormal (i.e, Beyer’s equation 16) and normal (i.e., Beyer’s equation 18) distributions of lengths within age classes.\nBeyer’s formulae are implemented by modifying group_by() and summarize() used previously. Specifically the standard deviation of lengths is calculated (in sdlen) so that the CV of lengths can be calculated (in cvlen). The correction factors are then computed (in cfn for the normal distribution and cfl for the lognormal distribution).\n\nsum2a <- group_by(df,age) |>\n  summarize(mnlen=mean(len),sdlen=sd(len),\n            true.mnwt=mean(wt2)) |>\n  mutate(cvlen=sdlen/mnlen,\n         cfn=1+b*(b-1)/2*(cvlen^2),      # eqn 18\n         cfl=(1+cvlen^2)^(b*(b-1)/2),    # eqn 16\n         pr.mnwt=exp(loga)*mnlen^b,\n         pr.mnwt.n=pr.mnwt*cfn,\n         pr.mnwt.l=pr.mnwt*cfl,\n         dif.mnwt=(pr.mnwt-true.mnwt)/true.mnwt*100,\n         dif.mnwt.n=(pr.mnwt.n-true.mnwt)/true.mnwt*100,\n         dif.mnwt.l=(pr.mnwt.l-true.mnwt)/true.mnwt*100) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\nThese calculations were again repeated 1000 times and summarized in the bottom two rows of Table 4. These results suggest that the mean bias in predicted weights at age when corrected with a correction factor appear to only be on the order of a quarter to a half a percent. These corrections seems to perform fairly consistently across a few different values of the weight-length regression exponent \\(b\\) and standard deviations in lengths (see Appendix).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage3\nage4\nage5\nage6\nage7\nage8\n\n\n\n\nNo correction\n-2.49\n-1.97\n-1.74\n-1.50\n-1.32\n-1.39\n\n\nNormal (eqn 18)\n-0.43\n-0.45\n-0.52\n-0.45\n-0.35\n-0.49\n\n\nLognormal (eqn 16)\n-0.41\n-0.45\n-0.51\n-0.44\n-0.35\n-0.48\n\n\n\nTable 4: Mean percentage difference in two types of corrected predicted mean and true mean weights by age class for 1000 simulations.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhy Worry About This?\nWhy am I worried about this if the bias is on the order of 4% or less? First, for my application, we are estimating mean weight so that we can expand to total biomass. While a 4% error on an individual fish may seem inconsequential, that error can become quite important when expanded to represent total biomass, especially when it is a consistent negative bias.\nSo, why worry about correction factors when I can easily predict the weight for individual fish with the weight-length regression and then summarize these fish to get mean weight at age? In my situation, it appears that some of our mean lengths at age, and by extension mean weights at age, are poorly estimated because of small sample sizes at some ages. I am considering fitting a growth model (e.g., von Bertalanffy growth model) to the length-at-age data such that the fitted model can be used to predict mean lengths at age. The advantage of this is that information at other ages can be used to inform the calculation of mean length at an age. [The potential downside, of course, is that I would be prescribing a smooth curve to the growth trajectory.] If I can then estimate mean weights at age with minimal bias from the mean lengths at age from the growth model, then this could (I would need to test this) be beneficial in my situation.\n \n\n\nSummary\nMean weights at age appear to be estimated with bias when a weight-length relationship is applied to mean lengths at age without any correction factor. The correction factors suggested by Beyer (1991) are easy to implement and seem to reduce the bias in predicted mean weights-at-age to near negligible levels. Thus, if mean weights at age cannot be predicted from individual fish, then it may be possible to get reasonable estimates from the weight-length relationship and mean lengths at age.\n \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBeyer, J.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. The plyr package is also used but it is not loaded because I am only going to use one specific function from plyr (i.e., mapvalues()).]\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)   # for mutate(), case_when()\nlibrary(forcats) # for fct_recode(), fct_collapse()\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nI have received a few queries recently that can be categorized as “How do I collapse a list of categories or values into a shorter list of categories or values?” For example, one user wanted to collapse species of fish into their respective families. Another user wanted to collapse years into decades. Data wrangling such as this is common in fisheries and is briefly described below.\n \n\n\nSample Data\nThe following creates a very simple sample of 250 individuals on which the species (as a short abbreviation) and year of capture were recorded. Because I am creating random example data below, I set the random number seed to make the results reproducible.\n\nset.seed(678394)  # for reproducibility of random data\nn <- 250          # to allow easily changing sample size\ndat <- data.frame(species=sample(c(\"BLG\",\"LMB\",\"PKS\",\"WAE\",\"YEP\",\"CRP\"),\n                                 n,replace=TRUE),\n                  year=sample(1980:2017,n,replace=TRUE))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R|    species year\n#R|  1     YEP 1996\n#R|  2     PKS 2005\n#R|  3     PKS 2013\n#R|  4     YEP 2014\n#R|  5     CRP 2016\n#R|  6     PKS 2006\n\n\n \n\n\nRecode Categories\nThis example demonstrates how to change the codes in one variable (e.g., species abbreviations) to new codes in another variable (e.g., long species names).\nBefore recoding I find it easier to create a vector that contains the original codes to convert from. For example, unique() extracts the vector of species abbreviations found in the species variable of the example data, which I then saved in short and alphabetized to make the next steps easier.\n\nshort <- unique(dat$species) |>\n  sort()\nshort\n\n#R|  [1] \"BLG\" \"CRP\" \"LMB\" \"PKS\" \"WAE\" \"YEP\"\n\n\nIn addition, I also create a vector of codes that these codes will be converted to. For example, the long vector below contains the long-form names for each species (in the same order as the abbreviations in short)\n\nlong <- c(\"Bluegill\",\"Carp\",\"Largemouth Bass\",\n          \"Pumpkinseed\",\"Walleye\",\"Yellow Perch\")\n\nYou should “column-bind” these two vectors together to ensure that the codes align.\n\ncbind(short,long)\n\n#R|       short long             \n#R|  [1,] \"BLG\" \"Bluegill\"       \n#R|  [2,] \"CRP\" \"Carp\"           \n#R|  [3,] \"LMB\" \"Largemouth Bass\"\n#R|  [4,] \"PKS\" \"Pumpkinseed\"    \n#R|  [5,] \"WAE\" \"Walleye\"        \n#R|  [6,] \"YEP\" \"Yellow Perch\"\n\n\nThe mapvalues() function (from plyr) may be used to efficiently recode character (or factor) values.1 Because mapvalues() operates on a vector, it should be used within mutate() (from dplyr) to add a new variable with the recoded values to a data frame. Within mutate() the first argument to mapvalues() is the variable that contains the original data to be recoded. A vector of categories to code from is given in from= and a vector of new categories to code to is given in to=. For example, the combined use of mutate() and mapvalues() below demonstrates creating a new variable in the data frame with the long species names.1 The use of plyr:: in front of mapvalues() ensures that mapvalues() from plyr and not another package will be used and allows for not loading the entire plyr package.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(speciesL=plyr::mapvalues(species,from=short,to=long))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R|    species year     speciesL\n#R|  1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch\n#R|  2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed\n#R|  3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed\n#R|  4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch\n#R|  5     CRP 2016         Carp\n#R|  6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\nThis use of mapvalues() and mutate() is described in Section 2.2.7 of my book Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R.\n\n\n \nThe fct_recode() function (from forcats) can also be used to recode categories. Within mutate() the first argument to fct_recode() is the original factor variable. Subsequent arguments are of the form new level name equal to old level name.2 For example, the same recoding to long species name is shown below.2 Any levels not listed in fct_recode() will be retained with their original names.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(speciesL2=fct_recode(species,\n                              \"Bluegill\" = \"BLG\",\n                              \"Carp\" = \"CRP\",\n                              \"Largemouth Bass\" = \"LMB\",\n                              \"Pumpkinseed\" = \"PKS\",\n                              \"Walleye\" = \"WAE\",\n                              \"Yellow Perch\" = \"YEP\"))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R|    species year     speciesL    speciesL2\n#R|  1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch\n#R|  2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed\n#R|  3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed\n#R|  4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch\n#R|  5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp\n#R|  6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed\n\n\n \n\n\nCollapse Categories\nIn some instances, one may want to collapse some categories into a single category (e.g., species into a family). This is easily accomplished with mapvalues() or fct_recode() by simply repeating some of the “to” categories. For example, family contains family names that correspond to the species names in the data frame. Note how multiple species have the same family name category.\n\nfam <- c(\"Centrarchidae\",\"Cyprinidae\",\"Centrarchidae\",\n         \"Centrarchidae\",\"Percidae\",\"Percidae\")\ncbind(short,long,fam)\n\n#R|       short long              fam            \n#R|  [1,] \"BLG\" \"Bluegill\"        \"Centrarchidae\"\n#R|  [2,] \"CRP\" \"Carp\"            \"Cyprinidae\"   \n#R|  [3,] \"LMB\" \"Largemouth Bass\" \"Centrarchidae\"\n#R|  [4,] \"PKS\" \"Pumpkinseed\"     \"Centrarchidae\"\n#R|  [5,] \"WAE\" \"Walleye\"         \"Percidae\"     \n#R|  [6,] \"YEP\" \"Yellow Perch\"    \"Percidae\"\n\n\nThe example below shows how to convert the species name abbreviations to family names. In addition, the last use of mapvalues() shows how to change the long-form names to family names. This last example is, of course, repetitive, but it is used here to demonstrate how mutate() allows a variable that was “just created” to be immediately used.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(family=plyr::mapvalues(species,from=short,to=fam),\n         family2=plyr::mapvalues(speciesL,from=long,to=fam))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R|    species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R|  1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R|  2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|  3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|  4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R|  5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R|  6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n\n\nThe “collapsing” of multiple levels into one level can also be accomplished with fct_collapse() (from forcats). The first argument to this function is again the variable containing the “old” levels. Subsequent arguments are formed by setting a new level name equal to a vector containing old level names to collapse.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(family3=fct_collapse(species,\n                              \"Centarchidae\" = c(\"BLG\",\"PKS\",\"LMB\"),\n                              \"Percidae\" = c(\"WAE\",\"YEP\"),\n                              \"Cyprinidae\" = c(\"CRP\")))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R|    species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R|  1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R|  2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|  3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|  4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R|  5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R|  6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|         family3\n#R|  1     Percidae\n#R|  2 Centarchidae\n#R|  3 Centarchidae\n#R|  4     Percidae\n#R|  5   Cyprinidae\n#R|  6 Centarchidae\n\n\n \n\n\nCollapse Values into Categories\nIt is also common to categorize a numeric variable. For example, a “decade” variable is derived from the year variable in this example.\nThe case_when() function (from dplyr) may be used to efficiently collapse discrete values into categories. This function also operates on vectors and, thus, must be used with mutate() to add a variable to a data frame. The arguments to case_when() are a series of two-sided formulae where the left-side is a conditioning statement based on the original data and the right-side is the value that should appear in the new variable when that condition is TRUE. For example, the first line in case_when() below asks “if the year variable is in the values from 1980 to 1989 then the new category should be ‘1980s’.”3 For example, the code below creates a new variable called decade that identifies the decade that corresponds to the year-of-capture variable.3 The colon operator creates a sequence of all integers between the two numbers separated by the colon. The %in% is used on conditional statements to determine if a value is contained within a vector, returning TRUE if it is and FALSE if it is not.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(decade=case_when(\n    year %in% 1980:1989 ~ \"1980s\",\n    year %in% 1990:1999 ~ \"1990s\",\n    year %in% 2000:2009 ~ \"2000s\",\n    year %in% 2010:2019 ~ \"2010s\"\n  ))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R|    species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R|  1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R|  2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|  3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|  4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R|  5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R|  6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|         family3 decade\n#R|  1     Percidae  1990s\n#R|  2 Centarchidae  2000s\n#R|  3 Centarchidae  2010s\n#R|  4     Percidae  2010s\n#R|  5   Cyprinidae  2010s\n#R|  6 Centarchidae  2000s\n\n\nThe lines in case_when() operate sequentially (like a series of “if” statements) such that the above operation can be more succinctly coded as below. Also note in this example that the resulting variable is numeric rather than categorical (simply as an example).\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(decade2=case_when(\n    year <= 1989 ~ 1980,\n    year <= 1999 ~ 1990,\n    year <= 2009 ~ 2000,\n    year <= 2019 ~ 2010,\n  ))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R|    species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R|  1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R|  2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|  3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|  4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R|  5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R|  6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R|         family3 decade decade2\n#R|  1     Percidae  1990s    1990\n#R|  2 Centarchidae  2000s    2000\n#R|  3 Centarchidae  2010s    2010\n#R|  4     Percidae  2010s    2010\n#R|  5   Cyprinidae  2010s    2010\n#R|  6 Centarchidae  2000s    2000\n\nstr(dat)\n\n#R|  'data.frame':  250 obs. of  9 variables:\n#R|   $ species  : chr  \"YEP\" \"PKS\" \"PKS\" \"YEP\" ...\n#R|   $ year     : int  1996 2005 2013 2014 2016 2006 2002 2012 2013 2014 ...\n#R|   $ speciesL : chr  \"Yellow Perch\" \"Pumpkinseed\" \"Pumpkinseed\" \"Yellow Perch\" ...\n#R|   $ speciesL2: Factor w/ 6 levels \"Bluegill\",\"Carp\",..: 6 4 4 6 2 4 5 1 3 6 ...\n#R|   $ family   : chr  \"Percidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Percidae\" ...\n#R|   $ family2  : chr  \"Percidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Percidae\" ...\n#R|   $ family3  : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Centarchidae\",..: 3 1 1 3 2 1 3 1 1 3 ...\n#R|   $ decade   : chr  \"1990s\" \"2000s\" \"2010s\" \"2010s\" ...\n#R|   $ decade2  : num  1990 2000 2010 2010 2010 2000 2000 2010 2010 2010 ...\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou may be motivated from this example to use case_when() to develop a length category variable from measure lengths. While this is possible it is not efficient as you would have several conditions within case_when() (to span all measured lengths) and you would need to make sure that your conditions covered the range of measured lengths. I urge you to examine lencat() in FSA for the purpose of creating length categories (see examples here).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{h.ogle2018,\n  author = {Derek H.

I also set the default ggplot theme to theme_bw() for a classic “black-and-white” plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nA common graphic produced by many fisheries scientists is a length frequency histogram. As it turns out there are a few “tricks” to make a length frequency histogram appear as I expect most fisheries folks would want it to appear – primarily, left-inclusive (i.e., 100 would be in the 100-110 bin and not the 90-100 bin). In this post, I show how to construct a length frequency histograms with ggplot2 using my preferences.\nThe data are lengths of Lake Erie Walleye (Sander vitreus) captured during October-November, 2003-2014.1 My primary interest is in the tl (total length in mm), sex, and loc variables2 and I will focus on 2014 (as an example).1 These data are available in the FSAdata package and formed many of the examples in Chapter 12 of the Age and Growth of Fishes: Principles and Techniques book.2 See here for more details\n\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nWE <- dplyr::filter(WalleyeErie2,year==2014)\n\n \n\n\nBasic Length Frequency\nMaking the histogram (Figure 1) begins by identifying the data frame to use in data= and the tl variable to use for the x-axis as an aes()thetic in ggplot(). The histogram is then constructed with geom_histogram(), which I customize as follows:\n\nSet the width of the length bins with binwidth=.\nBy default the bins are centered on breaks created from binwidth=. The bins can be changed to begin on these breaks by using boundary= set to the desired value of a first break, regardless of whether that break is in the data or not. I use boundary=0 so that bins will start on breaks that make sense relative to binwidth= (e.g., 0, 25, 50, 75, etc.).\nBins are left-exclusive and right-inclusive by default. Use closed=\"left\" to make the bins the desired left-inclusive and right-exclusive.\nThe fill color of the bins is set with fill= (I prefer a slight gray).\nThe outline color of the bins is set with color= (defaults to the same as fill=; I prefer a dark boundary to make the bins obvious).\n\nThe scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_continuous() are primarily used to provide labels (i.e., names) for the y- and x-axes, respectively. By default, the bins of the histogram will “hover” slightly above the x-axis, which I find annoying. The expand= in scale_y_continuous() is used to expand the lower limit of the y-axis by a multiple of 0 (thus, not expand the lower-limit) and expand the upper limit of the y-axis by a multiple of 0.05 (thus, the upper-limit will by 5% higher than the tallest bin so that the top frame of the plot will not touch the tallest bin).33 The resultant plot was assigned to an object so that name must be typed and run to see the plot.\n\nlenfreq1 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 fill=\"gray80\",color=\"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\")\nlenfreq1\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Length frequency of histogram of Lake Erie Walleye, 2014.\n\n\n\n\nThis base object/plot can be modified by adding (using +) to it as demonstrated later.\n \n\n\nStacked by Other Variable\nIt may be useful to see the distribution of categories of fish (e.g., sex) within the length frequency bins (Figure 2). To do this, add fill= in the aes()thetic in ggplot() and set it equal to the variable that identifies the separation within each bin (e.g., sex). The bins will be stacked by this variable if position=\"stack\" in geom_histogram().4 The fill colors for each group can be set in a number of ways, but they are set manually below with scale_fill_manual().4 This is the default and would not need to be explicitly set below).\n\nlenfreq2 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl,fill=sex)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 color=\"black\",position=\"stack\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"gray80\",\"gray40\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\")\nlenfreq2\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 stacked by sex.\n\n\n\n\nStacked histograms are difficult to interpret in my opinion. In a future post, I will show how to use empirical density functions to examine distributions among categories. For the time being, see below.\n \n\n\nSeparated by Other Variable(s)\nA strength of ggplot2 is that it can easily make the same plot for several different levels of another variable; e.g., separate length frequency histograms by sex (Figure 3). The plot (e.g., lenfreq from above) can be separated into different “facets” with facet_wrap(), which takes the variable to separate by within vars() as the first argument.\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_wrap(vars(sex))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex.\n\n\n\n\nIf the faceted groups have very different sample sizes then it may be useful to use a potentially different y-axis scale for each facet by including scales=\"free_y\" in facet_wrap() (Figure 4). Similarly, a potentially different scale can be used for each x-axis with scales=\"free_x\" or for both axes with scales=\"free\".\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_wrap(vars(sex),scales=\"free_y\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex with different frequency scales.\n\n\n\n\nPlots may be faceted over multiple variables with facet_grid() (Figure 5), where the variables that identify the rows and variables for a grid of facets are included (within vars()) in rows= and cols=, respectively. Both scales can not be “free” with facet_grid(), the scale can only be “free” within a row or column.\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_grid(rows=vars(loc),cols=vars(sex),scales=\"free_y\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex and location of capture with different frequency scales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{h.ogle2019,\n  author = {Derek H.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. One function from investr is also used but the whole package is not loaded here. The data are also from FSAdata, which is not loaded below. I also set the default ggplot theme to theme_bw() for a classic “black-and-white” plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).\n\n\n\nlibrary(FSA)     # for vbFuns(), vbStarts(), headtail()\nlibrary(dplyr)   # for filter(), mutate()\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nThe most common questions that I receive through the fishR website are related to fitting a von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) to data and viewing the results. In this post, I briefly demonstrate how to fit a VBGF to a single group of data and then provide several options for how to view the fit of the function to those data.\nI will use lengths and ages of Lake Erie Walleye (Sander vitreus) captured during October-November, 2003-2014 available in FSAdata package. These data formed many of the examples in Ogle et al. (2017). My primary interest here is in the tl (total length in mm) and age variables1. I focus on female Walleye from location “1” captured in 2014 in this example.21 See more details about the data.2 For succinctness, I removed year and sex as they only had one category after filtering and three variables related to the location of capture.\n\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nwf14T <- WalleyeErie2 |>\n  filter(year==2014,sex==\"female\",loc==1) |>\n  select(-year,-sex,-setID,-loc,-grid)\nheadtail(wf14T)\n\n#R|       tl    w      mat age\n#R|  1   445  737 immature   2\n#R|  2   528 1571   mature   4\n#R|  3   380  506 immature   1\n#R|  323 488 1089 immature   2\n#R|  324 521 1408   mature   3\n#R|  325 565 1745   mature   3\n\n\n \n\n\nFitting the VBGF\nMethods for fitting a von Bertalannfy growth function (VBGF) are detailed in Ogle (2016) and Ogle et al. (2017). Thus, this methodology will only be briefly explained here.\nA function for the typical VBGF is constructed with vbFuns().33 Other parameterizations of the VBGF can be used with param= in vbFuns() as described in its documentation.\n\n( vb <- vbFuns(param=\"Typical\") )\n\n#R|  function (t, Linf, K = NULL, t0 = NULL) \n#R|  {\n#R|      if (length(Linf) == 3) {\n#R|          K <- Linf[[2]]\n#R|          t0 <- Linf[[3]]\n#R|          Linf <- Linf[[1]]\n#R|      }\n#R|      Linf * (1 - exp(-K * (t - t0)))\n#R|  }\n#R|  <bytecode: 0x0000025cb0885230>\n#R|  <environment: 0x0000025cb08cf440>\n\n\nSome of the methods below use the fact that the three parameters of the typical VBGF (\\(L_{\\infty}\\), \\(K\\), \\(t_{0}\\)) can be given to this function separately (in that order) or as a vector (still in that order). For example, both lines below can be used to predict the mean length for an age-3 fish with the given VBGF parameters.44 The parameters could be given in a different order but would need to be named; e.g., vb(3,t0=-0.5,K=0.3,Linf=300).\n\nvb(3,300,0.3,-0.5)\n\n#R|  [1] 195.0187\n\ntmp <- c(300,0.3,-0.5) \nvb(3,tmp)\n\n#R|  [1] 195.0187\n\n\nReasonable starting values for the optimization algorithm may be obtained with vbStarts(), where the first argument is a formula of the form lengths~ages where lengths and ages are replaced with the actual variable names that contain the observed lengths and ages, respectively, and data= is set to the data frame that contains those variables.\n\n( sv0 <- vbStarts(tl~age,data=wf14T) )\n\n#R|  $Linf\n#R|  [1] 645.2099\n#R|  \n#R|  $K\n#R|  [1] 0.3482598\n#R|  \n#R|  $t0\n#R|  [1] -1.548925\n\n\nThe nls() function is typically used to estimate parameters of the VBGF from observed data. The first argument is a formula that has lengths on the left-hand-side and the VBGF function created above on the right-hand-side. The VBGF function has the ages variable as its first argument and then Linf, K, and t0 as the remaining arguments (just as they appear here). Again, the data frame with the observed lengths and ages is given to data= and the starting values derived above are given to start=.\n\nfit0 <- nls(tl~vb(age,Linf,K,t0),data=wf14T,start=sv0)\n\nThe parameter estimates and confidence intervals are extracted from the saved nls() object with coef() and confint(), respectively.5 They are column-bound together here for aesthetic reasons.5 This confint() requires the MASS package which is usually loaded automatically with base R.\n\ncbind(Est=coef(fit0),confint(fit0))\n\n#R|              Est        2.5%       97.5%\n#R|  Linf 648.208364 629.6754671 669.0341553\n#R|  K      0.361540   0.3223327   0.4043957\n#R|  t0    -1.283632  -1.4592315  -1.1207317\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fit Using stat_function()\nHere all “layers” of the plot will use the same data; thus, data= and the aes()thetic mappings are defined in ggplot(). Observed lengths and ages are added to the plot with geom_point(). The points in Figure 1 were made slightly larger than the default (with size=) and also with a fairly low transparency value to handle considerable over-plotting. scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_continuous() control aspects of y- and x-axes, respectively – labels for axes are given in name=, minimum and maximum limits for the axis are in limits=, and specific major breaks for the axis are in breaks=.6 Finally, the fitted model line is added to the plot with stat_function() with the VBGF function created above in fun= and a list of arguments to this function in args=.7 In Figure 1 I made the model line a little wider than the default. Finally the theme() was modified to remove the minor grid lines from both axes.86 seq(0,700,100) makes a vector of numbers from 0 to 700 in increments of 100 and 0:11 makes a vector of integers from 0 to 11.7 The usage here exploits the fact that all three parameters of the VBGF can be given in the first parameter argument, Linf=.8 Thus the gridlines only appear for labelled axis breaks.\n\nggplot(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",\n                     limits=c(0,700),breaks=seq(0,700,100)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=coef(fit0)),linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe model line can be displayed outside the range of observed ages by including minimum and maximum values in xlim= over which the function in fun= will be evaluated. In Figure 2 I add a dashed line for the model that includes evaluation at ages outside the observed range of ages (first stat_function()) and then plotted the model line for observed ages on top of that (second stat_function()). This gives the impression of using a dashed line only for the ages that would be extrapolated.99 I would usually change the axis expansion factors here to clean this plot up a bit.\n\nggplot(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=coef(fit0)),\n                xlim=c(-1,12),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=coef(fit0)),linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014. The dashed line shows the model fit outside the range of observed ages.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fit Using geom_smooth()\ngeom_smooth() can use nls() to fit the VBGF “behind the scenes” and then add the resultant model line to the plot. For this purpose geom_smooth() requires method=\"nls\" and se=FALSE.10 In addition, arguments for fitting the VBGF required by nls() must be in a list given to methods.args=. Minimum required arguments for fitting the VBGF are the VBGF formula= and start=ing values as shown for nls() above. Figure 3 uses geom_smooth() in this way to reproduce Figure 1.10 se=FALSE is required because this argument is not implemented in nls().\n\nggplot(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"nls\",se=FALSE,\n              method.args=list(formula=y~vb(x,Linf,K,t0),start=sv0),\n              color=\"black\",linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fit from Predicted Values\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 can also be constructed from lengths predicted at a variety of ages “outside” of any ggplot() layers. I find it easier when using this method to first create a vector of ages over which the fitted model will be evaluated is then constructed. In this case the ages extend beyond the observed range of ages. The seq()uence produced here will have 101 age values between -1 and 12.1111 Use a larger value for length.out= to make the line produced further below more smooth.\n\nages <- seq(-1,12,length.out=101)\n\nThe mean length at each of these ages is predicted with predict(), where the age vector just created is set equal to the name of the age variable in the nls() object inside of data.frame(). The vector of ages and predicted mean lengths are put into a data frame for plotting below.1212 Here the data frame is called preds and it has two variables named age and fit.\n\npreds <- data.frame(age=ages,\n                    fit=predict(fit0,data.frame(age=ages)))\nheadtail(preds)\n\n#R|        age       fit\n#R|  1   -1.00  63.17547\n#R|  2   -0.87  90.03596\n#R|  3   -0.74 115.66322\n#R|  99  11.74 642.36300\n#R|  100 11.87 642.63138\n#R|  101 12.00 642.88743\n\n\n \nThese predicted mean lengths-at-age are then used to add a fitted model line to a plot of observed lengths-at-age with geom_line(). However, because the observed and predicted data are in different data frames, the data= and mapped aes()thetics are declared within the appropriate geoms rather than within ggplot(). For example, geom_point() is used below to add the observed data to the plot and geom_line() is used below to add the modeled line. Note below that separate geom_line()s are used to show the modeled line over extrapolated and observed ages.13 The results in Figure 4 reproduce Figure 2.13 Also note the use of filter() to reduce the predicted lengths-at-age to the observed ages.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl),size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  geom_line(data=preds,aes(x=age,y=fit),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data=filter(preds,age>=0,age<=11),aes(x=age,y=fit),linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014. The dashed line shows the model fit outside the range of observed ages.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fit with Confidence Band\nThe main reason for introducing the idea of constructing a graphic from predicted values is that it allows for the opportunity to add confidence and prediction bands around the fitted model line (Figure 5).\nCreation of this plot requires modifying the data frame of predicted mean lengths at age with confidence (or prediction) intervals for the mean length at each age. As mentioned previously, constructing these intervals is not straightforward with non-linear models. However, confidence (or prediction) intervals can be estimated with Taylor series approximations as implemented in predFit() of investr.14 predFit() requires the saved nls() object as its first argument, a data frame of ages over which to make predictions as the second argument, and either interval=\"confidence\" for confidence intervals or interval=\"prediction\" for prediction intervals.14 Use of :: here allows predFit() from investr to be used without loading all of investr.\n\npreds <- data.frame(age=ages,\n                    investr::predFit(fit0,data.frame(age=ages),\n                                     interval=\"confidence\"))\nheadtail(preds)\n\n#R|        age       fit       lwr       upr\n#R|  1   -1.00  63.17547  32.40761  93.94334\n#R|  2   -0.87  90.03596  62.76575 117.30618\n#R|  3   -0.74 115.66322  91.59342 139.73301\n#R|  99  11.74 642.36300 625.59243 659.13357\n#R|  100 11.87 642.63138 625.76065 659.50210\n#R|  101 12.00 642.88743 625.91982 659.85504\n\n\nA confidence band for mean lengths at age is added to the plot with geom_ribbon() where the lower part of the ribbon is at the lower confidence values (i.e., ymin=lwr) and the upper part is at the upper confidence value (i.e., ymax=upr).15 fill= gives the color of the enclosed ribbon.15 Add geom_ribbon() first so that it is behind the points and model lines.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_ribbon(data=preds,aes(x=age,ymin=lwr,ymax=upr),fill=\"gray80\") +\n  geom_point(data=wf14T,aes(y=tl,x=age),size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  geom_line(data=preds,aes(x=age,y=fit),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data=filter(preds,age>=0,age<=11),aes(x=age,y=fit),linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014 with a 95% confidence band. The dashed line shows the model fit outside the range of observed ages.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdd Equation to Plot\nThe following function can be used to extract the model coefficients from an nls() object and place them into a “plotmath” format to be added to the ggplot graph.\n\nmakeVBEqnLabel <- function(fit,digits=c(1,3,3)) {\n  # Isolate coefficients (and control decimals)\n  cfs <- coef(fit)\n  Linf <- formatC(cfs[[\"Linf\"]],format=\"f\",digits=digits[1])\n  K <- formatC(cfs[[\"K\"]],format=\"f\",digits=digits[2])\n  # Handle t0 differently because of minus in the equation\n  t0 <- cfs[[\"t0\"]]\n  t0 <- paste0(ifelse(t0<0,\"+\",\"-\"),formatC(abs(t0),format=\"f\",digits=digits[3]))\n  # Put together and return\n  paste0(\"TL==\",Linf,\"~bgroup('[',1-e^{-\",K,\"~(age\",t0,\")},']')\")\n}\n\n \nThe object returned from this function can be added to the ggplot graph with annotate() as shown below.1616 The x=, y=, hjust=, and vjust= arguments are used to position and justify the text and may take some trial-and-error to get what you want.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_ribbon(data=preds,aes(x=age,ymin=lwr,ymax=upr),fill=\"gray80\") +\n  geom_point(data=wf14T,aes(y=tl,x=age),size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  geom_line(data=preds,aes(x=age,y=fit),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data=filter(preds,age>=0,age<=11),aes(x=age,y=fit),linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank()) +\n  annotate(geom=\"text\",label=makeVBEqnLabel(fit0),parse=TRUE,\n           size=4,x=Inf,y=-Inf,hjust=1.1,vjust=-0.5)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014 with a 95% confidence band.

My primary interest here is in the tl (total length in mm), age, and sex variables.1 I initially focus on Walleye from location “1” captured in 2014 in this example.21 See more details about the data.2 For succinctness, I removed year as it only had one level after filtering and three variables related to the location of capture.\n\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nw14T <- WalleyeErie2 |>\n  filter(year==2014,loc==1) |>\n  select(-year,-setID,-loc,-grid)\nheadtail(w14T)\n\n#R|       tl    w    sex      mat age\n#R|  1   445  737 female immature   2\n#R|  2   528 1571 female   mature   4\n#R|  3   499 1138   male   mature   4\n#R|  612 521 1408 female   mature   3\n#R|  613 565 1745 female   mature   3\n#R|  614 530 1553   male   mature   5\n\n\nAs in the previous post, a function that uses the typical VBGF to predict mean length given a set of VBGF parameters and age is needed.33 Other parameterizations of the VBGF can be used with param= in vbFuns() as described in its documentation.\n\n( vb <- vbFuns(param=\"Typical\") )\n\n#R|  function(t,Linf,K=NULL,t0=NULL) {\n#R|    if (length(Linf)==3) { K <- Linf[[2]]\n#R|                           t0 <- Linf[[3]]\n#R|                           Linf <- Linf[[1]] }\n#R|    Linf*(1-exp(-K*(t-t0)))\n#R|    }\n#R|  <bytecode: 0x000001ca99a60fb0>\n#R|  <environment: 0x000001ca99ba5060>\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fits Using geom_smooth()\nOne of the simpler ways to plot multiple VBGF fits uses geom_smooth(), which, as described in the previous post, uses nls() to fit the model “behind-the-scenes.” Thus, a set of starting values is needed. It is critical to note that using geom_smooth() requires the same starting values for each group. With this warning, possible starting values for the optimization algorithm may be obtained with vbStarts() as shown in the previous post.\n\n( sv0 <- vbStarts(tl~age,data=w14T) )\n\n#R|  $Linf\n#R|  [1] 591.1587\n#R|  \n#R|  $K\n#R|  [1] 0.3930388\n#R|  \n#R|  $t0\n#R|  [1] -1.544479\n\n\nThe use of geom_smooth() to produce separate lines for the groups is exactly as described in the previous post, except that the variable for identifyng the groups (i.e., sex in this example) must be mapped to the color= aes()thetic. For Figure 1 I also used scale_color_manual() to demonstrate how to change the default colors of the points and lines. Additionally, in theme() I moved the legend into the plot panel4 and removed the default sex label that would appear on top of the legend.4 In this case the legend is placed 80% down the x-axis and 20% up the y-axis.\n\nggplot(data=w14T,aes(x=age,y=tl,color=sex)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"male\"=\"darkblue\",\"female\"=\"darkred\")) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"nls\",se=FALSE,\n              method.args=list(formula=y~vb(x,Linf,K,t0),start=sv0),\n              linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank(),\n        legend.position=c(0.8,0.2),\n        legend.title=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to male and female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n \nAn alternative visualization is to put the two groups into separate panels using facet_wrap().5 Note that color is superfluous in Figure 2, but I kept it for comparison to Figure 1. Mapping color to a variable will produce a legend by default. This legend was removed (in theme()), however, because it is redundant with the panel labels.5 Simply put the grouping variable inside of vars() as the argument to facet_wrap().\n\nggplot(data=w14T,aes(x=age,y=tl,color=sex)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"male\"=\"darkblue\",\"female\"=\"darkred\")) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"nls\",se=FALSE,\n              method.args=list(formula=y~vb(x,Linf,K,t0),start=sv0),\n              linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank(),\n        legend.position=\"none\") +\n  facet_wrap(vars(sex))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to male and female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFitting the VBGF to Multiple Groups\nMethods for fitting a von Bertalanfy growth function (VBGF) to multiple groups are detailed in Ogle (2016) and Ogle et al. (2017). Thus, this methodology will only be briefly explained here.\nFitting the VBGF to multiple groups requires creating an expression, rather than a function, with the VBGF defined over the multiple groups. The expression below codes the VBGF using the length and age variables from the data set used here (i.e., tl and age) and assuming different parameters should be estimated for each group.6 Identifying the different groups is accomplished here by appending [group], where group is replaced with the specific variable name that identifies the groups (i.e., sex here). The expression is assigned to an object name (i.e., vbLKt here).6 See Ogle (2016) and Ogle et al. (2017) for examples of how to fit the VBGF assuming situations where some parameters differ and some do not across groups.\n\nvbLKt <- tl~Linf[sex]*(1-exp(-K[sex]*(age-t0[sex])))\n\n \nI created vectors of group names (with unique()) and the number of groups (with length()) for ease of use below.\n\n( grps <- unique(w14T$sex) )\n\n#R|  [1] female male  \n#R|  Levels: female male\n\n( ngrps <- length(grps) )\n\n#R|  [1] 2\n\n\n \nThis model has six parameters – \\(L_{\\infty}\\), \\(K\\), and \\(t_{0}\\) for each of the two groups (male and female Walleye). Starting values must be declared for each of these parameters. Here I find starting values from the data ignoring the groups (using vbStarts() as described in the previous post) and replicate those starting values for both groups.77 In some instances using the same starting values for both groups will not result in model convergence. See Ogle (2016) and Ogle et al. (2017) for suggestions for handling those cases.\n\n( sv0 <- vbStarts(tl~age,data=w14T) )\n\n#R|  $Linf\n#R|  [1] 591.1587\n#R|  \n#R|  $K\n#R|  [1] 0.3930388\n#R|  \n#R|  $t0\n#R|  [1] -1.544479\n\n\nMap replicates the starting values in the list from vbStarts() with rep (the replicated function), the object returned from vbStarts(), and a numeric vector that explains how many times each parameter should be repeated (i.e., the same as the number of groups).\n\n( svLKt <- Map(rep,sv0,c(2,2,2)) )\n\n#R|  $Linf\n#R|  [1] 591.1587 591.1587\n#R|  \n#R|  $K\n#R|  [1] 0.3930388 0.3930388\n#R|  \n#R|  $t0\n#R|  [1] -1.544479 -1.544479\n\n\nThe model is fit to the data by including the VBGF expression object, data=, and start= as arguments to nls(). The parameter estimates and confidence intervals may be extracted from the saved nls() object with coef() and confint().8 Note that the parameters will be appended with numbers in the alphabetical order of the groups.9 Thus, in this example, it is seen that the estimated \\(L_{\\infty}\\) for females (appended with a “1”) is greater than that for males.8 Column-bound here for aesthetic reasons.9 Unless your chose to order the levels of the group variable differently.\n\nfitLKt <- nls(vbLKt,data=w14T,start=svLKt)\ncbind(Ests=coef(fitLKt),confint(fitLKt))\n\n#R|               Ests        2.5%       97.5%\n#R|  Linf1 648.2083813 627.2685519 672.1242978\n#R|  Linf2 574.1512545 561.6722232 588.0005006\n#R|  K1      0.3615399   0.3171679   0.4106412\n#R|  K2      0.3354067   0.2946359   0.3805994\n#R|  t01    -1.2836317  -1.4846294  -1.0991040\n#R|  t02    -1.9702829  -2.2978880  -1.6783578\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fits from Predicted Values\nThe model fit above can be used to predict the mean length at age for all groups, both within and outside the observed range of ages. These results can then be used to show the model fit by group. However, a bit of work outside of ggplot is required to prepare the relevant data.\nA data frame that contains predicted mean lengths at age over a range of ages for all groups is needed. I begin this process by finding (and assigning to an object for later use) the range of ages for each group.1010 as.data.frame() removes the tibble returned by group_by(), which I don’t prefer\n\nobsagerng <- w14T |>\n  group_by(sex) |>\n  summarize(min=min(age),\n            max=max(age)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\nobsagerng\n\n#R|       sex min max\n#R|  1 female   0  11\n#R|  2   male   1  11\n\n\nFrom this, I create a temporary vector of 101 ages11 evenly spaced over a range of ages larger than what was observed.1211 Use a larger value for length.out= to make the line produced further below more smooth.12 Zero was an observed age here, if not I usually make sure it is included.\n\nages <- seq(-1,12,length.out=101)\n\nI then create a data frame that has the name of each group repeated as many times as there are ages in the temporary age vector (i.e., 101 here) and has ages from the temporary age vector repeated for each group (i.e., twice here). Note the careful use of each= and times= in rep() below.\n\npreds <- data.frame(sex=rep(grps,each=length(ages)),\n                    age=rep(ages,times=ngrps))\nheadtail(preds)\n\n#R|         sex   age\n#R|  1   female -1.00\n#R|  2   female -0.87\n#R|  3   female -0.74\n#R|  200   male 11.74\n#R|  201   male 11.87\n#R|  202   male 12.00\n\n\nPredicted mean lengths at each age for each group are then appended to this data frame by giving the fitted nls() object and this data frame to predict().\n\npreds <- preds |>\n  mutate(fit=predict(fitLKt,preds))\nheadtail(preds)\n\n#R|         sex   age       fit\n#R|  1   female -1.00  63.17550\n#R|  2   female -0.87  90.03599\n#R|  3   female -0.74 115.66324\n#R|  200   male 11.74 568.37143\n#R|  201   male 11.87 568.61804\n#R|  202   male 12.00 568.85411\n\n\nFinally, I add a fourth variable that will be TRUE if the age is within the range of observed ages for the group. group_by() below behaves like a loop here in the sense that what follows that line will be completed for the first group, then the second group, and so on. For the mutate() lines suppose that we are working with the first group (i.e., “female”). In this case, unique(sex) will return female such that obsagerng[obsagerng$sex==unique(sex),] will find the row of obsagerng where its sex variable is equal to “female”. The $min appended to that will extract just the value in the min variable of that row (so the minimum observed age for females). The age>=obsagerng[obsagerng$sex==unique(sex),]$min portion is thus asking if the age variable in preds is greater than or equal to the minimum observed age for females. If it is it will return TRUE, otherwise FALSE will be returned. The second part mutate() asks if the age variable in preds is less than or equal to the maximum observed age for females, again returning TRUE or FALSE as appropriate. Those two conditions are connected with an & such that if they are both TRUE then a TRUE is returned, otherwise a FALSE is returned. The result is that the new inrng variable will be TRUE if the age variable within preds is within the observed range of ages for each sex in preds.1313 FSA::peek() is used here to show an evenly spaced 20 rows in the data frame. This provides more output than headtail() for observing the results of code.\n\npreds <- preds |>\n  group_by(sex) |>\n  mutate(inrng=age>=obsagerng[obsagerng$sex==unique(sex),]$min &\n               age<=obsagerng[obsagerng$sex==unique(sex),]$max)\nFSA::peek(preds)\n\n#R|         sex   age      fit inrng\n#R|  1   female -1.00  63.1755 FALSE\n#R|  11  female  0.30 282.5622  TRUE\n#R|  21  female  1.60 419.6791  TRUE\n#R|  32  female  3.03 511.9351  TRUE\n#R|  43  female  4.46 566.9479  TRUE\n#R|  53  female  5.76 597.4205  TRUE\n#R|  64  female  7.19 617.9233  TRUE\n#R|  74  female  8.49 629.2802  TRUE\n#R|  85  female  9.92 636.9214  TRUE\n#R|  96  female 11.35 641.4779 FALSE\n#R|  106   male -0.48 225.8590 FALSE\n#R|  117   male  0.95 358.5543 FALSE\n#R|  128   male  2.38 440.6943  TRUE\n#R|  138   male  3.68 487.8581  TRUE\n#R|  149   male  5.11 520.7348  TRUE\n#R|  159   male  6.41 539.6122  TRUE\n#R|  170   male  7.84 552.7712  TRUE\n#R|  181   male  9.27 560.9168  TRUE\n#R|  191   male 10.57 565.5938  TRUE\n#R|  202   male 12.00 568.8541 FALSE\n\n\n \nFigure 3 is created by combining similar code from the previous post and the use of color= from above. In brief, geom_point() adds points at the observed lengths at age, the first geom_line() adds the fitted models from the predicted mean lengths at all ages in preds as dashed lines, and the second geom_line() adds the fitted models from the predicted mean lengths only at observed ages for each group as solid lines.1414 Note the use filter() in the second geom_line() so that only data for which inrng==TRUE is used.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=w14T,aes(x=age,y=tl,color=sex),\n             size=2,alpha=0.3) +\n  geom_line(data=preds,aes(x=age,y=fit,color=sex),\n              linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data=filter(preds,inrng),aes(x=age,y=fit,color=sex),\n              linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"male\"=\"darkblue\",\"female\"=\"darkred\")) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank(),\n        legend.position=c(0.8,0.2),\n        legend.title=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to male and female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014. The dashed lines show the model fits outside the range of observed ages for each sex.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fit with Confidence Band\nCreating a graphic that has the model fit with confidence (or prediction) bands for multiple groups again requires some preparatory work before using ggplot().\nFor simplicity and completeness of presentation, the code below is repeated from above.\n\nvb <- vbFuns(param=\"Typical\")     ## Typical VBGF\ngrps <- unique(w14T$sex)          ## Names of groups\nngrps <- length(grps)             ## Number of groups\nobsagerng <- w14T |>              ## Range of observed ages by group\n  group_by(sex) |>\n  summarize(min=min(age),\n            max=max(age))\nsv0 <- vbStarts(tl~age,data=w14T) ## Starting values ignoring groups\n\nAs before, starting values are needed for each group. Here, however, I place the starting values into a data frame where each row corresponds to one group and a variable that identifies the groups is included.1515 For simplicity name this variable the same as it is in the main data frame.\n\n( svLKt <- data.frame(sex=grps,\n                      Map(rep,sv0,c(ngrps,ngrps,ngrps))) )\n\n#R|       sex     Linf         K        t0\n#R|  1 female 591.1587 0.3930388 -1.544479\n#R|  2   male 591.1587 0.3930388 -1.544479\n\n\nThe starting values created here are the same for each group. This will likely work in most cases (of fish growth data) but likely not all. Starting values can be entered into the data frame manually as shown below.1616 Ogle (2016) and Ogle et al. (2017) discuss alternative methods of finding starting values. But note that this may take some work if there are many groups.\n\n## Not run: Demo of manually entering starting values; not needed in this case\n( svLKt <- data.frame(sex=grps,\n                      Linf=c(630,580),\n                      K=c(0.34,0.34),\n                      t0=c(-1,-2)) )\n\nThe method used here basically loops through the groups, uses the procedures of the previous post (for one group) and above to find fitted values and confidence (or prediction) bands for each group, and then (row) binds those results together to produce a synthetic data frame for all groups. The process for a single group is wrapped into a function called vbLOOP1() below. The ordered arguments to vbLOOP1() are a group name, the original data frame, the data frame of starting values for all groups, the data frame of observed age ranges, and a vector that identifies the overall range over which to predict mean lengths at age. vbLOOP1 will default to returning confidence intervals, but prediction intervals can be returned by including interval=\"prediction\".1717 See code comments for the parts of this function that are specific to this case and, thus, might have to be changed for other data.\n\nvbLOOP1 <- function(grp,dat,svs,oagerng,eagerng,interval=\"confidence\") {\n  ## !!

Here I examine just female walleye captured in four years, as an example. Note here that year must be explicitly turned to a factor so that it will be treated as a group identifier rather than a numeric value.\n\nwfT <- WalleyeErie2 |>\n  filter(sex==\"female\",loc==1,year %in% c(2005,2008,2011,2014)) |>\n  mutate(year=factor(year)) |>\n  select(-loc,-setID,-grid,-sex)\n\nThe code below is repeated from above, but everywhere where sex was in the code has been changed to year (our new grouping variable). Once again note that using the same starting values for all groups may not always work (but it did here).\n\ngrps <- unique(wfT$year)          ## Names of groups\nngrps <- length(grps)             ## Number of groups\nobsagerng <- wfT |>               ## Range of observed ages by group\n  group_by(year) |>\n  summarize(min=min(age),\n            max=max(age))\n\nsv0 <- vbStarts(tl~age,data=wfT)  ## Starting values ignoring groups\n( svLKt <- data.frame(year=grps,\n                      Map(rep,sv0,c(ngrps,ngrps,ngrps))) )\n\n#R|    year     Linf         K        t0\n#R|  1 2005 703.7264 0.2529961 -1.903874\n#R|  2 2008 703.7264 0.2529961 -1.903874\n#R|  3 2011 703.7264 0.2529961 -1.903874\n#R|  4 2014 703.7264 0.2529961 -1.903874\n\n\nThe vbLOOP1() function needs to be modified by replacing all instances of sex to year.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. I also set the default ggplot theme to theme_bw() for a classic “black-and-white” plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).\n\n\n\nlibrary(FSA)          # for WhitefishLC, ageBias(), plotAB()\nlibrary(dplyr)        # for mutate()\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nAge-bias and difference plots can be constructed with plot() and plotAB() in the FSA package. However, these types of plots can be more flexibly constructed using ggplot2. Below I will use ggplot2 to recreate many of the plots shown in the documentation for plot() and plotAB().\n \n\n\nData\nThe WhitefishLC data frame from FSA.1 contains age readings made by two readers on scales, fin rays, and otoliths, along with consensus readings for each structure.1 These data are loaded automatically with library(FSA).\n\nhead(WhitefishLC)\n\n#R|    fishID  tl scale1 scale2 scaleC finray1 finray2 finrayC otolith1 otolith2\n#R|  1      1 345      3      3      3       3       3       3        3        3\n#R|  2      2 334      4      3      4       3       3       3        3        3\n#R|  3      3 348      7      5      6       3       3       3        3        3\n#R|  4      4 300      4      3      4       3       2       3        3        3\n#R|  5      5 330      3      3      3       4       3       4        3        3\n#R|  6      6 316      4      4      4       2       3       3        6        5\n#R|    otolithC\n#R|  1        3\n#R|  2        3\n#R|  3        3\n#R|  4        3\n#R|  5        3\n#R|  6        6\n\n\nIntermediate and summary statistics for the comparison of paired ages (e.g., between consensus scale and otolith ages) can be extracted from the objected returned by ageBias() from FSA.22 As described in the documentation.\n\nab1 <- ageBias(scaleC~otolithC,data=WhitefishLC,\n               ref.lab=\"Otolith Age\",nref.lab=\"Scale Age\")\n\nFor example, the $data object of ab13 contains the original paired age estimates, the differences between those two estimates, and the mean of those two estimates.3 ab1 because that was the name assigned to the results from ageBias() in this example.\n\nhead(ab1$data)\n\n#R|    scaleC otolithC diff mean\n#R|  1      3        3    0  3.0\n#R|  2      4        3    1  3.5\n#R|  3      6        3    3  4.5\n#R|  4      4        3    1  3.5\n#R|  5      3        3    0  3.0\n#R|  6      4        6   -2  5.0\n\n\nIn addition, the $bias object of ab1 contains summary statistics of ages for the first structure given in the ageBias() formula by each age of the second structure given in that formula. For example, the first row below gives the number, minimum, maximum, mean, and standard error of the scale ages that were paired with an otolith age of 1. Additionally there is a t-test, adjusted p-value, and a significance statement for testing whether the mean scale age is different from the otolith age. Finally, confidence intervals (defaults to 95%) for the mean scale age at an otolith age of 1 is given, with a statement about whether a confidence interval could be calculated.44 See the documentation for ageBias() for the criterion used to decide if the confidence interval can be calculated.\n\nhead(ab1$bias)\n\n#R|    otolithC  n min max     mean        SE          t   adj.p   sig       LCI\n#R|  1        1  9   1   2 1.444444 0.1756821  2.5298218 0.28212 FALSE 1.0393208\n#R|  2        2  7   1   5 2.000000 0.5773503  0.0000000 1.00000 FALSE 0.5872748\n#R|  3        3 17   1   6 3.352941 0.2416423  1.4605937 0.81743 FALSE 2.8406824\n#R|  4        4 18   2   6 3.833333 0.2322102 -0.7177407 1.00000 FALSE 3.3434126\n#R|  5        5  8   4   8 5.250000 0.4909902  0.5091751 1.00000 FALSE 4.0889926\n#R|  6        6 10   3   6 4.600000 0.2666667 -5.2500003 0.00686  TRUE 3.9967581\n#R|         UCI canCI\n#R|  1 1.849568  TRUE\n#R|  2 3.412725  TRUE\n#R|  3 3.865200  TRUE\n#R|  4 4.323254  TRUE\n#R|  5 6.411007  TRUE\n#R|  6 5.203242  TRUE\n\n\nThe results in $bias.diff are similar to those for $bias except that the difference in age between the two structures is summarized for each otolith age.\n\nhead(ab1$bias.diff)\n\n#R|    otolithC  n min max       mean        SE          t   adj.p   sig         LCI\n#R|  1        1  9   0   1  0.4444444 0.1756821  2.5298218 0.28212 FALSE  0.03932075\n#R|  2        2  7  -1   3  0.0000000 0.5773503  0.0000000 1.00000 FALSE -1.41272519\n#R|  3        3 17  -2   3  0.3529412 0.2416423  1.4605937 0.81743 FALSE -0.15931758\n#R|  4        4 18  -2   2 -0.1666667 0.2322102 -0.7177407 1.00000 FALSE -0.65658738\n#R|  5        5  8  -1   3  0.2500000 0.4909902  0.5091751 1.00000 FALSE -0.91100742\n#R|  6        6 10  -3   0 -1.4000000 0.2666667 -5.2500003 0.00686  TRUE -2.00324188\n#R|           UCI canCI\n#R|  1  0.8495680  TRUE\n#R|  2  1.4127252  TRUE\n#R|  3  0.8652000  TRUE\n#R|  4  0.3232540  TRUE\n#R|  5  1.4110074  TRUE\n#R|  6 -0.7967581  TRUE\n\n\nThese data frames are used in ggplot2 code below to create various versions of age-bias and difference plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAt times multiple data frames will be used when constructing the same plot so that layers of the plot can have different variables.\n\n\n \n\n\nBasic Age-Bias Plot\nFigure 1 is the age-bias plot created by default by plotAB() from FSA.\n\nFSA::plotAB(ab1)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Default age-bias plot from plotAB() in FSA.\n\n\n\n\n \nFigure 1 is largely recreated (Figure 2) with the following ggplot2 code.\n\nggplot(data=ab1$bias) +\n  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),width=0) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),shape=21) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Recreation of the default age-bias plot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nThe specifics of the code above are described below.\n\nThe base data used in this plot is the $bias data.frame discussed above.\nThe 45o agreement line (i.e., slope of 1 and intercept of 0) is added with geom_abline(), using a dashed linetype= and a gray color=. This “layer” is first so that it sits behind the other results.\nError bars are added with geom_errorbar(). The aes()thetics here map the consensus otolith age to the x= axis and the lower and upper confidence interval values for the mean consensus scale age at each consensus otolith age to ymin= and ymax=. The color= of the lines are mapped to the sig variable so that points that are significantly different from the 45o agreement line will have a different color (with scale_color_manual() described below). Finally, width=0 assures that the error bars will not have “end caps.”\nPoints at the mean consensus scale age (y=) for each otolith age (x=) are added with geom_point(). Again, the color= and fill= are mapped to the sig variable so that they will appear different depending on whether the points are significantly different from the 45o agreement line or not. Finally, shape=21 represents a plotted point as an open circle that is outlined with color= and filled with fill=.\nscale_fill_manual() and scale_color_manual() are used to set the colors and fills for the levels in the sig variable. Note that guide=\"none\" is used so that a legend is not constructed for the colors and fills.\nscale_x_continuous() and scale_y_continuous() are used to set the labels (with name=) and axis breaks for the x- and y-axes, respectively. The names are drawn from labels that were given in the original call to ageBias() and stored in ab1.\n\nThe gridlines and the size of the fonts could be adjusted by modifying theme theme, which I did not do here for simplicity.\n \n\n\nMore Examples\nBelow are more examples of how ggplot2 can be used to recreate graphs from plot() in FSA. For example, Figure 3 is similar to Figure 2, but uses $bias.diff from ab1 to plot mean differences between scale and otolith ages against otolith ages. The reference for differences is a horizontal line at 0 so geom_abline() from above was replaced with geom_hline() here.\n\nggplot(data=ab1$bias.diff) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),width=0) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),shape=21) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,\"-\",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Age difference plot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n \nFigure 4 is similar but it includes the raw data points from $data and colors the mean (and confidence intervals) for the differences based on the significance as in Figure 2. Because data were drawn from different data frames (i.e., ab1$data and ab1$bias.diff) the data= and aes= arguments had to be moved into the specific geom_s. Also note that the raw data were made semi-transparent (with alpha=0.1) to emphasize the over-plotting of the discrete ages.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),alpha=0.1,size=1.75) +\n  geom_errorbar(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),\n                width=0) +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),\n             shape=21,size=1.75) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=seq(0,25,1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,\"-\",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Age difference plot using ggplot2 including points for individual observations.\n\n\n\n\n \nFigure 5 is the same as Figure 4 except that a loess smoother has been added with geom_smooth() to emphasize the trend in the differences in ages. The smoother should be fit to the raw data so be sure to use ab1$data in geom_smooth(). The smoother defaults to blue (as shown here) but I decreased the width of the line slightly with linewidth=0.65.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),alpha=0.1,size=1.75) +\n  geom_errorbar(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),\n                width=0) +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),\n             shape=21,size=1.75) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=seq(0,25,1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,\"-\",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5) +\n  geom_smooth(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),linewidth=0.65)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Age difference plot using ggplot2 including points for individual observations and a loess smoother.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhat Prompted This\nGraphics made in ggplot2 are more flexible than the ones produced in FSA. For example, a user recently asked if it was possible to make an “age-bias plot” that used “error bars” based on the standard deviation rather than the standard error. While it is questionable whether this is what should be plotted, it is nevertheless up to the user and their use case. Because this cannot be done using the plots in FSA we turned to ggplot to make such a graph.\nStandard deviations are not returned in any of the ageBias() results (saved in ab1). However, the standard error and sample size are returned in the $bias data frame. The standard deviation can be “back-calculated” from these two values using SD=SE*sqrt(n). Two new variables called LSD and USD that are the means minus and plus two standard deviations can then be created. All three of these variables are added to the $bias data frame using mutate() from dplyr.\n\nab1$bias <- ab1$bias |>\n  mutate(SD=SE*sqrt(n),\n         LSD=mean-2*SD,\n         USD=mean+2*SD)\n\nA plot (Figure 6) like the very first plot above but using two standard deviations for the error bars is then created by mapping ymin= and ymax= to LSD and USD, respectively, in geom_errorbar(). Note that I removed the color related to the significance test as those don’t pertain to the results when using standard deviations to represent “error bars.”\n\nggplot(data = ab1$bias)+\n  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LSD,ymax=USD),width=0) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name =ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Mean scale age for each otolith age with error bars represented by two standard deviations.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to demonstrate the flexibility of using ggplot with these type of data, I used a violin plot to show the distribution of scale ages for each otolith age while also highlighting the mean scale age for each otolith age (Figure 7). The violin plots are created with geom_violin() using the raw data stored in $data. The group= must be set to the x-axis variable (i.e., otolith age) so that a separate violin will be constructed for each age on the x-axis. I filled the violins with grey to make them stand out more.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_violin(data=WhitefishLC,aes(x=otolithC,y=scaleC,group=otolithC),\n              fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$bias,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean),size=2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Violin plots and mean scale age at each otolith age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{lant2021,\n  author = {Michael Lant},\n  title = {Age {Bias} {Plots} in Ggplot2},\n  date = {2021-03-15},\n  url = {https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR//blog/posts/2021-3-15-AgeBiasPlots},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMichael Lant. 2021, March 15.

These functions are used below only to show what could be done in older versions of FSA but should now be done as described in this post. DO NOT USE any of the functions below that begin with FSAmisc::.\n\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nWe deprecated fitPlot() from FSA v0.9.0 and fully removed it by the start of 2022. We took this action to make FSA more focused on fisheries applications and to eliminate “black box” functions. fitPlot() was originally designed for students to quickly visualize the results of one- and two-way ANOVAs and simple, indicator variable, and logistic regressions.1 We now feel that students are better served by learning how to create these visualizations using methods provided by ggplot2, which require more code, but are more modern, flexible, and transparent.1 Over time functionality for non-linear regressions was added.\nThe basic plots produced by fitPlot() are recreated here using ggplot2 to provide a resource to help users that relied on fitPlot() transition to ggplot2.\n \n\n\nExample Data\nExamples below use the Mirex data set from FSA, which contains the concentration of mirex in the tissue and the body weight of two species of salmon (chinook and coho) captured in six years. The year variable is converted to a factor for modeling purposes and a new variable is created that indicates if the mirex concentration was greater that 0.2 or not. This new variable is used to demonstrate a logistic regression.22 peek() from FSA is used to examine a portion of the data from evenly-spaced row.\n\ndata(Mirex,package=\"FSA\")\nMirex <- Mirex |>\n  mutate(year=factor(year),\n         gt2=ifelse(mirex>0.2,1,0))\npeek(Mirex,n=10)\n\n#R|      year weight mirex species gt2\n#R|  1   1977   0.41  0.16 chinook   0\n#R|  14  1977   3.29  0.23    coho   1\n#R|  27  1982   0.70  0.10    coho   0\n#R|  41  1982   5.09  0.27    coho   1\n#R|  54  1986   1.82  0.12 chinook   0\n#R|  68  1986   8.40  0.13 chinook   0\n#R|  81  1992  10.00  0.48 chinook   1\n#R|  95  1996   5.70  0.16    coho   0\n#R|  108 1999   5.11  0.11    coho   0\n#R|  122 1999  11.82  0.09 chinook   0\n\n\n \n\n\nOne-Way ANOVA\nThe code below fits a one-way ANOVA model to examine if mean weight differs by species.\n\naov1 <- lm(weight~species,data=Mirex)\nanova(aov1)\n\n#R|  Analysis of Variance Table\n#R|  \n#R|  Response: weight\n#R|             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    \n#R|  species     1  282.4 282.399  27.657 6.404e-07 ***\n#R|  Residuals 120 1225.3  10.211                      \n#R|  ---\n#R|  Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n \nThere are at least two simple ways to visualize results from a one-way ANOVA. First, summarized means of raw data with 95% confidence intervals derived from the standard error, sample size, and degrees-of-freedom specific to each group are shown. These are computed below.\n\nsumdata <- Mirex |>\n  group_by(species) |>\n  summarize(n=n(),\n            mn=mean(weight),\n            se=se(weight)) |>\n  mutate(lci=mn-qt(0.975,df=n-1)*se,\n         uci=mn+qt(0.975,df=n-1)*se)\nsumdata\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 2 × 6\n#R|    species     n    mn    se   lci   uci\n#R|    <fct>   <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n#R|  1 chinook    67  6.31 0.474  5.37  7.26\n#R|  2 coho       55  3.26 0.279  2.70  3.82\n\n\n \nSecond, marginal means may be predicted or estimated from the fitted model.3 The main difference from above is that confidence intervals for the marginal means use an “overall” standard deviation and degrees-of-freedom estimated from across all groups. The estimated marginal means may be computed with with emmeans() from emmeans.43 These are discussed in detail in this vignette from the emmeans package.4 They may also be computed with predict(aov1,newdata=data.frame(species=c(\"chinook\",\"coho\")),interval=\"confidence\").\n\naov1mc <- emmeans::emmeans(aov1,specs=pairwise~species)\naov1mcs <- summary(aov1mc)\naov1mcs$emmeans\n\n#R|   species emmean    SE  df lower.CL upper.CL\n#R|   chinook   6.31 0.390 120     5.54     7.09\n#R|   coho      3.26 0.431 120     2.40     4.11\n#R|  \n#R|  Confidence level used: 0.95\n\n\n \nfitPlot() from FSA used the summarized means with 95% confidence intervals for both species.\n\nFSAmisc::fitPlot(aov1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUsing Manually Summarized Means\nThe summarized means saved in sumdata above can be plotted as shown below to recreate the fitPlot() result. width=0.1 in geom_errorbar() is used to reduce the width of the “caps” at the confidence values and group=1 is needed in geom_line() as there is only one point for each factor level. Changes (themes, colors, labels, etc) to this basic plot can be made as usual for ggplot()s (and is illustrated further below).\n\nggplot(data=sumdata,mapping=aes(x=species)) +\n  geom_errorbar(mapping=aes(ymin=lci,ymax=uci),width=0.1) +\n  geom_line(mapping=aes(y=mn,group=1)) +\n  geom_point(mapping=aes(y=mn))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUsing Built-In Functions for Summarized Means\nThis plot can also be constructed without having previously summarized the group means by using stat_summary() coupled with mean_cl_normal() and mean(). Below note how each geom= in each stat_summary() mirrors what was used above. Also note the use of width=0.1 and group=1 here as done above.\n\nggplot(data=Mirex,mapping=aes(x=species,y=weight)) +  \n  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_cl_normal,geom=\"errorbar\",width=0.1) +  \n  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom=\"line\",mapping=aes(group=1)) +  \n  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom=\"point\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUsing Marginal Means from emmeans\nThe estimated marginal means may be plotted similarly to the manually summarized means. However, the aov1mcs$emmeans data frame created above is used, which also requires using lower.CL and upper.CL for the ymin= and ymax= in geom_errorbar() and emmean for the y= mean value in geom_line() and geom_point().55 Review the output from aov1mcs$emmeans above taking special note of the variable names.\n\nggplot(data=aov1mcs$emmeans,mapping=aes(x=species)) +\n  geom_errorbar(mapping=aes(ymin=lower.CL,ymax=upper.CL),width=0.1) +\n  geom_line(mapping=aes(y=emmean,group=1)) +\n  geom_point(mapping=aes(y=emmean))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTwo-Way ANOVA\nThe code below fits a two-way ANOVA model to examine if mean weight differs by species, by year, or by the interaction between species and year.\n\naov2 <- lm(weight~year*species,data=Mirex)\nanova(aov2)\n\n#R|  Analysis of Variance Table\n#R|  \n#R|  Response: weight\n#R|                Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    \n#R|  year           5 281.86  56.373  6.9954 1.039e-05 ***\n#R|  species        1 221.69 221.689 27.5099 7.648e-07 ***\n#R|  year:species   5 117.69  23.538  2.9208   0.01628 *  \n#R|  Residuals    110 886.44   8.059                      \n#R|  ---\n#R|  Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n \nfitPlot() from FSA used the mean with 95% confidence interval for all combinations of species and year.\n\nFSAmisc::fitPlot(aov2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUsing Built-In Functions for Summarized Means\nAgain, stat_summary() can be used to efficiently calculate and then plot the 95% confidence intervals and means similar to what was shown above for a one-way ANOVA. However, there are three major differences.\nFirst, in the main ggplot() call the color of the points and lines is mapped to one of the two factor variables (species in this case) whereas the other factor variable is mapped to x=.6 Second, the group= aesthetic for the line geom must be set to the factor that describes how the lines should be connected, which will be the same as the variable mapped to the color aesthetic (e.g., species in this case). Third, the intervals and (possibly) the points at each level on the x-axis will overlap if they are not “dodged” a small amount.7 The “dodge” amount should be set outside the geom()s so that each geom uses the same amount of “dodging.” This will assure that the intervals, points, and connecting lines for each level defined by the colors align. Below this “dodge” amount is set with position_dodge() and saved to an object called pd which is then set equal to position= in each geom().6 These two variables can, of course, be exchanged. However, I generally prefer to have the variable with more levels on the x-axis.7 Note this same problem occurs for the fitPlot(), though there is no simple solution for it.\n\npd <- position_dodge(width=0.2)\nggplot(data=Mirex,mapping=aes(x=year,y=weight,color=species)) +  \n  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_cl_normal,geom=\"errorbar\",width=0.2,position=pd) + \n  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom=\"line\",mapping=aes(group=species),position=pd) +  \n  stat_summary(fun=mean,geom=\"point\",position=pd)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUsing Marginal Means from emmeans\nThe mearginal means are again computed with emmeans(), but with year:species so that the marginal means and confidence intervals are estimated for each combination of year and species.\n\naov2mc <- emmeans::emmeans(aov2,specs=pairwise~year:species)\naov2mcs <- summary(aov2mc)\naov2mcs$emmeans\n\n#R|   year species emmean    SE  df lower.CL upper.CL\n#R|   1977 chinook   3.35 0.819 110    1.723     4.97\n#R|   1982 chinook   3.94 0.819 110    2.319     5.57\n#R|   1986 chinook   6.20 0.819 110    4.571     7.82\n#R|   1992 chinook   8.91 1.073 110    6.788    11.04\n#R|   1996 chinook   7.79 0.856 110    6.090     9.48\n#R|   1999 chinook   8.71 0.787 110    7.148    10.27\n#R|   1977 coho      3.06 0.819 110    1.436     4.68\n#R|   1982 coho      3.43 0.819 110    1.808     5.06\n#R|   1986 coho      2.71 0.819 110    1.090     4.34\n#R|   1992 coho      4.60 1.270 110    2.084     7.12\n#R|   1996 coho      2.67 1.004 110    0.681     4.66\n#R|   1999 coho      4.05 1.159 110    1.753     6.35\n#R|  \n#R|  Confidence level used: 0.95\n\n\nThe plot of these marginal means is constructed similarly to that for the one-way ANOVA but using the dodging and color aesthetics described above.\n\npd <- position_dodge(width=0.2)\nggplot(data=aov2mcs$emmeans,mapping=aes(x=year,color=species)) +\n  geom_errorbar(mapping=aes(ymin=lower.CL,ymax=upper.CL),width=0.2,position=pd) +\n  geom_line(mapping=aes(y=emmean,group=species),position=pd) +\n  geom_point(mapping=aes(y=emmean),position=pd)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression\nThe code below fits a simple linear regression for examining the relationship between mirex concentration and salmon weight.\n\nslr <- lm(mirex~weight,data=Mirex)\nanova(slr)\n\n#R|  Analysis of Variance Table\n#R|  \n#R|  Response: mirex\n#R|             Df  Sum Sq  Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    \n#R|  weight      1 0.22298 0.222980  26.556 1.019e-06 ***\n#R|  Residuals 120 1.00758 0.008396                      \n#R|  ---\n#R|  Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n \nfitPlot() from FSA showed the best-fit line with a 95% confidence band.\n\nFSAmisc::fitPlot(slr,interval=\"confidence\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUsing Manually Predicted Values I\nOne method for recreating this plot is to create a new data frame that first has the two variables of observed data and then adds on predicted values of the response at each observed value of the explanatory variable with 95% confidence intervals. The two observed variables are selected from the original data frame with select(). If this new data frame is given to newdata= in predict() with interval=\"confidence\" then the predicted values (and 95% confidence intervals) will be constructed at each value of the explanatory variable. The two data frames are then column-bound together with cbind() to make one data frame for plotting (further below).\n\nslrdf <- Mirex |>\n  select(weight,mirex)\nslrdf <- cbind(slrdf,predict(slr,newdata=slrdf,interval=\"confidence\"))\npeek(slrdf,n=6)\n\n#R|      weight mirex       fit        lwr       upr\n#R|  1     0.41  0.16 0.1226593 0.09588108 0.1494376\n#R|  24    7.75  0.34 0.2119229 0.19088398 0.2329618\n#R|  49    0.34  0.02 0.1218080 0.09477073 0.1488453\n#R|  73    1.90  0.10 0.1407796 0.11907549 0.1624837\n#R|  98    9.10  0.29 0.2283406 0.20287925 0.2538019\n#R|  122  11.82  0.09 0.2614192 0.22530410 0.2975342\n\n\nThe confidence band is first plotted as a “ribbon” with the best-fit line then added followed by the observed points. In this plot, weight is globally mapped to x= in ggplot() so that it will be used for each geom. The lower and upper confidence values are mapped to ymin= and ymax= in geom_ribbon(), whereas the predicted or “fit”ted values are mapped to y= geom_line() to make the line and the observed mirex concentrations are mapped to y= in geom_point() to plot the observed points. Further note the use of alpha= to make the confidence band semi-transparent and size= to make the fitted line slightly larger than the default. Again all aspects of this plot can be changed in the usual ggplot way.\n\nggplot(data=slrdf,mapping=aes(x=weight)) +\n  geom_ribbon(mapping=aes(ymin=lwr,ymax=upr),alpha=0.2) +\n  geom_line(mapping=aes(y=fit),size=1) +\n  geom_point(mapping=aes(y=mirex))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUsing Manually Predicted Values II\nWith more sparse data sets there may not be enough predicted values to make a smooth plot. In these cases, a separate data frame with more designated values for the explanatory variable is useful. The first line below creates a data frame of weights that consists of 101 evenly spaced values from the minimum to maximum observed weight in the original data frame. Concentrations of mirex at each of these weights are then predicted from the regression line and bound to the data frame.\n\nnd <- data.frame(weight=seq(min(slrdf$weight),max(slrdf$weight),length.out=101))\nnd <- cbind(nd,predict(slr,newdata=nd,interval=\"confidence\"))\npeek(slrdf,n=6)\n\n#R|      weight mirex       fit        lwr       upr\n#R|  1     0.41  0.16 0.1226593 0.09588108 0.1494376\n#R|  24    7.75  0.34 0.2119229 0.19088398 0.2329618\n#R|  49    0.34  0.02 0.1218080 0.09477073 0.1488453\n#R|  73    1.90  0.10 0.1407796 0.11907549 0.1624837\n#R|  98    9.10  0.29 0.2283406 0.20287925 0.2538019\n#R|  122  11.82  0.09 0.2614192 0.22530410 0.2975342\n\n\nThe plot is now constructed from two data frames – slrdf with the original observed data and nd with predicted concentrations of mirex at specifically chosen weights. Given this, the data to use must be specifically declared within each geom, with geom_ribbon() and geom_line() using the predicted data frame (i.e., nd) and geom_point() using the observed data (i.e., slrdf).\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_ribbon(data=nd,mapping=aes(x=weight,ymin=lwr,ymax=upr),alpha=0.2) +\n  geom_line(data=nd,mapping=aes(x=weight,y=fit),size=1) +\n  geom_point(data=slrdf,mapping=aes(x=weight,y=mirex))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUsing A Built-In Function\nThe best-fit line can also be added to a scatterplot with geom_smooth(), where method=\"lm\" makes sure that a linear model is used for the “smoother.”\n\nggplot(data=Mirex,mapping=aes(x=weight,y=mirex)) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",alpha=0.2) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIndicator Variable Regression\nThe code below fits an indicator variable regression to examine if the relationship between mirex concentration and salmon weight differs betwen species.\n\nivr <- lm(mirex~weight*species,data=Mirex)\nanova(ivr)\n\n#R|  Analysis of Variance Table\n#R|  \n#R|  Response: mirex\n#R|                  Df  Sum Sq  Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    \n#R|  weight           1 0.22298 0.222980 26.8586 9.155e-07 ***\n#R|  species          1 0.00050 0.000498  0.0600   0.80690    \n#R|  weight:species   1 0.02744 0.027444  3.3057   0.07158 .  \n#R|  Residuals      118 0.97964 0.008302                      \n#R|  ---\n#R|  Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n \nfitPlot() from FSA showed the best-fit line for both species.\n\nFSAmisc::fitPlot(ivr,interval=\"confidence\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUsing Manually Predicted Values\nThe process of constructing a similar plot in ggplot() follows the same general procedure as that for a simple linear regression. First, make a data frame that has the observed variables used in the model and predicted values and confidence limits for each observation.88 Again, one may want to make a data frame with more values of the explanatory variable if the observed data is sparse.\n\nivrdf <- select(Mirex,weight,mirex,species)\nivrdf <- cbind(ivrdf,predict(ivr,newdata=ivrdf,interval=\"confidence\"))\npeek(ivrdf,n=6)\n\n#R|      weight mirex species        fit        lwr       upr\n#R|  1     0.41  0.16 chinook 0.13939054 0.09905499 0.1797261\n#R|  24    7.75  0.34 chinook 0.20990801 0.18638517 0.2334308\n#R|  49    0.34  0.02    coho 0.09192064 0.04956596 0.1342753\n#R|  73    1.90  0.10    coho 0.12580003 0.09660968 0.1549904\n#R|  98    9.10  0.29 chinook 0.22287784 0.19567885 0.2500768\n#R|  122  11.82  0.09 chinook 0.24900965 0.21056798 0.2874513\n\n\n \nThen plot the data as before but making sure to map color= and fill= (just for the ribbon) to the species factor variable.\n\nggplot(data=ivrdf,mapping=aes(x=weight,color=species)) +\n  geom_ribbon(mapping=aes(ymin=lwr,ymax=upr,fill=species),alpha=0.2) +\n  geom_line(mapping=aes(y=fit),size=1) +\n  geom_point(mapping=aes(y=mirex))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUsing a Built-In Function\nThis plot can also be constructed with geom_smooth(), again making sure to map the color= and fill= to the species factor variable.\n\nggplot(data=Mirex,mapping=aes(x=weight,y=mirex,color=species,fill=species)) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",alpha=0.2) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLogistic Regression\nThe code below fits a logistic regression to examine the relationship between the probability that mirex concentration is greater than 0.2 and salmon weight.\n\nlogreg <- glm(gt2~weight,data=Mirex,family=\"binomial\")\nsummary(logreg)\n\n#R|  \n#R|  Call:\n#R|  glm(formula = gt2 ~ weight, family = \"binomial\", data = Mirex)\n#R|  \n#R|  Deviance Residuals: \n#R|      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  \n#R|  -1.7696  -0.7462  -0.5566   0.9537   1.9789  \n#R|  \n#R|  Coefficients:\n#R|              Estimate Std.

This post describes a more transparent (i.e., not a “black box”) and flexible set of methods for constructing similar plots using ggplot2 for those who will need to transition away from using fitPlot().\nAs mentioned in the examples above, each plot can be modified further using typical methods for ggplot2. These changes were not illustrated above to minimize the amount of code shown in this post. However, as an example, the code below shows a possible modification of the IVR plot shown above.\n\nggplot(data=Mirex,mapping=aes(x=weight,y=mirex,color=species,fill=species)) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",alpha=0.1,size=1.25) +\n  geom_point(size=1.5) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Mirex Concentration in Tissue\",limits=c(0,0.5),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Salmon Weight (kg)\",limits=c(0,15),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#E69F00\",\"#0072B2\"),\n                     aesthetics=c(\"color\",\"fill\")) +\n  theme(panel.grid.major=element_line(color=\"gray90\",linetype=\"dashed\"),\n        panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=rel(1.25)),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=rel(1.1)),\n        legend.position=c(0,1),\n        legend.justification=c(-0.05,1.02),\n        legend.title=element_blank(),\n        legend.text=element_text(size=rel(1.1)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{h.ogle2021,\n  author = {Derek H.

DO NOT USE any of the functions below that begin with FSAmisc::.\n\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nWe deprecated residPlot() from FSA v0.9.0 and fully removed it by the start of 2022. We took this action to make FSA more focused on fisheries applications and to eliminate “black box” functions. residPlot() was originally designed for students to quickly visualize residuals from one- and two-way ANOVAs and simple, indicator variable, and logistic regressions.1 We now feel that students are better served by learning how to create these visualizations using methods provided by ggplot2, which require more code, but are more modern, flexible, and transparent.1 Over time functionality for non-linear regressions was added.\nThe basic plots produced by residPlot() are recreated here using ggplot2 to provide a resource to help users that relied on residPlot() transition to ggplot2.\n \n\n\nExample Data\nMost examples below use the Mirex data set from FSA, which contains the concentration of mirex in the tissue and the body weight of two species of salmon (chinook and coho) captured in six years. The year variable is converted to a factor for modeling purposes and a new variable is created that indicates if the mirex concentration was greater that 0.2 or not. These same data were used in this post about removing fitPlot() from FSA.22 peek() from FSA is used to examine a portion of the data from evenly-spaced row.\n\ndata(Mirex,package=\"FSA\")\nMirex <- Mirex |>\n  mutate(year=factor(year),\n         gt2=ifelse(mirex>0.2,1,0))\npeek(Mirex,n=10)\n\n#R|      year weight mirex species gt2\n#R|  1   1977   0.41  0.16 chinook   0\n#R|  14  1977   3.29  0.23    coho   1\n#R|  27  1982   0.70  0.10    coho   0\n#R|  41  1982   5.09  0.27    coho   1\n#R|  54  1986   1.82  0.12 chinook   0\n#R|  68  1986   8.40  0.13 chinook   0\n#R|  81  1992  10.00  0.48 chinook   1\n#R|  95  1996   5.70  0.16    coho   0\n#R|  108 1999   5.11  0.11    coho   0\n#R|  122 1999  11.82  0.09 chinook   0\n\n\n \n\n\nOne-Way ANOVA\nThe code below fits a one-way ANOVA model to examine if mean weight differs by species.\n\naov1 <- lm(weight~species,data=Mirex)\nanova(aov1)\n\n#R|  Analysis of Variance Table\n#R|  \n#R|  Response: weight\n#R|             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    \n#R|  species     1  282.4 282.399  27.657 6.404e-07 ***\n#R|  Residuals 120 1225.3  10.211                      \n#R|  ---\n#R|  Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n \nresidPlot() from FSA produced a boxplot of residuals by group (left) and a histogram of residuals (right).\n\nFSAmisc::residPlot(aov1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nA data frame of the two variables used in the ANOVA appended with the fitted values and residuals from the model fit must be made to construct this plot using ggplot(). Studentized residuals are included below in case you would prefer to plot them.33 These are “internally” Studentized residuals. “Externally” Studentized residuals can be obtained with rstandard().\n\ntmp <- Mirex |>\n  select(weight,species) |>\n  mutate(fits=fitted(aov1),\n         resids=resid(aov1),\n         sresids=rstudent(aov1))\npeek(tmp,n=8)\n\n#R|      weight species     fits     resids    sresids\n#R|  1     0.41 chinook 6.314776 -5.9047761 -1.8814369\n#R|  17    4.77    coho 3.257091  1.5129091  0.4762846\n#R|  35    2.92 chinook 6.314776 -3.3947761 -1.0710643\n#R|  52    1.70    coho 3.257091 -1.5570909 -0.4902213\n#R|  70    9.53 chinook 6.314776  3.2152239  1.0139117\n#R|  87    0.90    coho 3.257091 -2.3570909 -0.7430562\n#R|  105   2.61    coho 3.257091 -0.6470909 -0.2035546\n#R|  122  11.82 chinook 6.314776  5.5052239  1.7507263\n\n\n \nThe histogram of residuals is constructed with geom_histogram() below. Note that the color of the histogram bars are modified and the bin width is set to better control the number of bars in the histogram. Finally, the bottom multiplier for the y-axis is set to zero so that that histogram bars do not “hover” above the x-axis.\n\nggplot(data=tmp,mapping=aes(x=resids)) +\n  geom_histogram(color=\"gray30\",fill=\"gray70\",binwidth=0.5) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe boxplot of residuals by group (species in this case) is constructed with geom_boxplot() below (again controlling the colors of the boxplot).\n\nggplot(data=tmp,mapping=aes(x=species,y=resids)) +\n  geom_boxplot(color=\"gray30\",fill=\"gray70\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThese plots can be further modified using methods typical for ggplot (see conclusion section).\n \n\n\nTwo-Way ANOVA\nThe code below fits a two-way ANOVA model to examine if mean weight differs by species, by year, or by the interaction between species and year.\n\naov2 <- lm(weight~year*species,data=Mirex)\nanova(aov2)\n\n#R|  Analysis of Variance Table\n#R|  \n#R|  Response: weight\n#R|                Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    \n#R|  year           5 281.86  56.373  6.9954 1.039e-05 ***\n#R|  species        1 221.69 221.689 27.5099 7.648e-07 ***\n#R|  year:species   5 117.69  23.538  2.9208   0.01628 *  \n#R|  Residuals    110 886.44   8.059                      \n#R|  ---\n#R|  Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n \nresidPlot() from FSA showed a boxplot of residuals by each combination of the two factor variables (left) and a histogram of the residuals (right).\n\nFSAmisc::residPlot(aov2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nA data frame of the three variables used in the ANOVA appended with the fitted values and residuals from the model fit must be constructed.\n\ntmp <- Mirex |>\n  select(weight,species,year) |>\n  mutate(fits=fitted(aov2),\n         resids=resid(aov2),\n         sresids=rstudent(aov2))\n\n \nThe histogram of residuals is constructed exactly as before and won’t be repeated here.

The scatterplot of residuals versus fitted values is constructed with geom_point() as below.

The rstudent() function does not work for non-linear models, but the Studentized residuals are computed with nlsResiduals() from nlstools. However, these values are “buried” in the Standardized residuals column of the resi2 matrix returned by that function; thus, it takes a little work to extract them as shown below.\n\ntmp <- SpotVA1 |>\n  select(tl,age) |>\n  mutate(fits=fitted(nlreg),\n         resids=resid(nlreg),\n         sresids=nlstools::nlsResiduals(nlreg)$resi2[,\"Standardized residuals\"])\npeek(tmp,n=8)\n\n#R|        tl age      fits     resids    sresids\n#R|  1    6.5   0  7.348034 -0.8480343 -0.8051925\n#R|  58   8.3   1  9.251581 -0.9515812 -0.9035082\n#R|  115  8.5   1  9.251581 -0.7515812 -0.7136121\n#R|  173  9.7   1  9.251581  0.4484188  0.4257650\n#R|  230  9.8   2 10.771696 -0.9716957 -0.9226066\n#R|  288 10.5   2 10.771696 -0.2716957 -0.2579700\n#R|  345 11.5   3 11.985613 -0.4856128 -0.4610802\n#R|  403 13.9   4 12.955010  0.9449900  0.8972498\n\n\n \nOnce this data frame is constructed the residual plot and histogram of residuals are constructed exactly as for linear regression and won’t be repeated here.\n \n\n\nConclusion\nThe residPlot() function in FSA was removed by 2022. This post describes a more transparent (i.e., not a “black box”) and flexible set of methods for constructing similar plots using ggplot2 for those who will need to transition away from using residPlot().55 Different “residual plots” are available in plot() (from base R when given an object from lm()), car::residualPlots(), DHARMa::plotResiduals(), and ggResidpanel::resid_panel().\nAs mentioned in the examples above, each plot can be modified further using typical methods for ggplot2. These changes were not illustrated above to minimize the amount of code shown in this post.

Implementing these suggestions will result in Figure 2 (A).\n\nName the second argument to ggplot() (i.e., mapping=). ggplot() is smart enough to figure this out but I think it is awkward to name the first argument (i.e., data=) but not the second.\nI moved the text for the axis labels (i.e., titles) into scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_continuous() for simplicity (and thus removed ylab() and xlab()).\nI changed expand=c(0,0) in scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_continuous() to expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0)) to follow more recent ggplot2 conventions. This still results in no scale expansion at the top or bottom of axis.\nI removed limits= in scale_fill_manual() and used a named vector in values= to accomplish the same task. I think this makes it easier to see which category gets which color.\nI removed ggtitle() as I am going to accomplish that same task with patchwork as shown below (i.e., where the two plots are place side-by-side).\nI used legend.title=element_blank() in theme() rather than labs(fill=\"\") to remove to legend title. I think(?) this handles the freed up space better.\nI included legend.position= in theme() here because Glassic et al. (2019) positioned the legend within the plot area and, thus, will need to be set specific to each plot (i.e., will need to manually find a “white area”).\n\n\nlen_wt_afs1 <- ggplot(data=length_weight_data,\n                      mapping=aes(x=length,y=weight,fill=species)) +\n  # set symbol shape and size\n  geom_point(shape=21,size=2) +\n  # set the limits, tick breaks, and scale expansion for the y- and x-axis\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Weight (g)\",\n                      limits=c(0,2400),breaks=seq(0,2400,400),\n                      expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Length (mm)\",limits=c(100,600),breaks=seq(100,600,100),\n                      expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0))) +\n  # set the symbol colors and make new labels for each level\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"lmb\"=\"black\",\"cat\"=\"white\"),\n                    labels=c(\"Largemouth Bass\",\"Channel Catfish\")) +\n  theme(\n    # remove legend title\n    legend.title=element_blank(),\n    # set legend position within the plot\n    legend.position = c(0.35,0.95)\n  )"

    "text": "Custom Theme for All Plots\nTheme elements that will be consistent across plots can be put into a custom theme that can then be easily applied to any plot. The code below, for example, shows the start of a new theme called theme_AFS() that has theme_classic() as its base but will have several elements replaced. theme_AFS() will use a base font size of 14 and Times New Roman as defaults, which will minimize some of the authors’ code (as described below).\n\ntheme_AFS <- function(base_size=14,base_family=\"Times New Roman\") {\n  theme_classic(base_size=base_size,base_family=base_family) +\n    theme(\n      ### Change theme elements here ###\n    )\n}\n\nWithin theme() I add nearly all of the elements that Glassic et al. (2019) included, though I reordered the items in a way that makes sense to me (e.g., axis title then axis tick labels then axis ticks then axis line). Other adjustments are:\n\nI removed text= because the font family was already set with base_family=.\nI removed legend.position= because, as described above, Glassic et al. (2019) positioned the legend within the plot area.\nI removed size=14 from axis.title.y=, axis.title.x=, axis.text.y=, and axis.text.x= because that was set with base_size=.\nI replaced axis.ticks.y= and axis.ticks.x= with axis.ticks= because their elements were the same and using axis.ticks= will set both at the same time.\n\n\ntheme_AFS <- function(base_size=14,base_family=\"Times New Roman\") {\n  theme_classic(base_size=base_size,base_family=base_family) +\n    theme(\n      # modify plot title,the B in this case\n      plot.title=element_text(family=\"Arial\",face=\"bold\"),\n      # margin for the plot\n      plot.margin=unit(c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5),\"cm\"),\n      # set axis label (i.e., title) colors and margins\n      axis.title.y=element_text(colour=\"black\",margin=margin(t=0,r=10,b=0,l=0)),\n      axis.title.x=element_text(colour=\"black\",margin=margin(t=10,r=0,b=0,l=0)),\n      # set tick label color, margin, and position and orientation\n      axis.text.y=element_text(colour=\"black\",margin=margin(t=0,r=5,b=0,l=0),\n                               vjust=0.5,hjust=1),\n      axis.text.x=element_text(colour=\"black\",margin=margin(t=5,r=0,b=0,l=0),\n                               vjust=0,hjust=0.5,),\n      # set size of the tick marks for y- and x-axis\n      axis.ticks=element_line(linewidth=0.5),\n      # adjust length of the tick marks\n      axis.ticks.length=unit(0.2,\"cm\"),\n      # set the axis size,color,and end shape\n      axis.line=element_line(colour=\"black\",linewidth=0.5,lineend=\"square\"),\n      # adjust size of text for legend\n      legend.text=element_text(size=12)\n    )\n}\n\ntheme_AFS() can then be “added” to any plot to apply its elements.

    "title": "Vaisvil et al. (2022) Hatching Date Figure",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nVaisvil et al. (2022) examined the effect of varying water levels on the timing of hatch dates and relative abundance of young-of-the-year Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) in a southwestern U.S. reservoir. Figure 4 of their publication showed the rate of change of water levels in the reservoir by day for 2017 and 2018, with the range of bass hatch dates noted. Interestingly they also included satellite images of the reservoir at the begninning of the hatch date range. In this post I recreate their Figure 4 using ggplot2.\n \n\n\nGetting Setup\nThe following packages are loaded for use below.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # for dplyr, ggplot2 packages\nlibrary(scales)     # for breaks_width(), label_date()\nlibrary(patchwork)  # for placing subpanels into one plot\n\n \n\n\nPlotting Raster Image\nFigure 4 in Vaisvil et al. (2022) consists of four panels with the left two panels being satellite images. I “clipped” both satellite images and saved them as PNG files for use here. Note that both images are the same size (number of pixels in both the horizontal and vertical directions).\nreadPNG() from png reads a PNG file and returns a three dimensional matrix of x- and y- pixel positions as the rows and columns and four “layers” corresponding to the red, green, blue, and transparency values for a pixel. This matrix of RGBT values, however, is indexed from the upper-left whereas plotting is usually indexed from the lower-left (i.e., from 0,0). This provides several problems that are commonly discussed on forums1. To address these issues I created a small helper function below based on several suggestions I found in the forums.1 For example, here.\n\npng2df <- function(f) {\n  ## Read the PNG file\n  df <- png::readPNG(f)\n  ## Convert to data.frame of x-y pixel positions and RGBT color for that pixel.\n  ##   Note that the Y variable is reversed as indexing starts in the\n  ##   upper-left (rather than lower-left for plotting)\n  grd <- expand.grid(1:nrow(df),1:ncol(df))\n  dim(df) <- c(nrow(df)*ncol(df),4)\n  df <- cbind(grd,as.data.frame(df)) |>\n    mutate(RGB=rgb(V1,V2,V3,V4),\n           y=-Var1,\n           y=y+max(abs(y))+1) |>\n    select(x=Var2,y=y,RGB)\n  df\n}\n\nThis function takes the PNG filename as its sole argument and returns a data frame of x-y pixel coordinates and the RGBT values to plot at those coordinates.\n\nimg17 <- png2df(\"EB_2017.png\")\nhead(img17)\n\n#R|    x   y       RGB\n#R|  1 1 455 #838577FF\n#R|  2 1 454 #717365FF\n#R|  3 1 453 #7A7C6CFF\n#R|  4 1 452 #737665FF\n#R|  5 1 451 #7C7F6DFF\n#R|  6 1 450 #787B69FF\n\n\nThe y-to-x aspect ratio of this image is needed for plotting purposes below (and is saved here in ar).\n\nar <- max(img17$y)/max(img17$x)\n\nThe image can be “plotted” by giving this image data frame object with appropriate mapping of aesthetics to ggplot() and then using geom_raster() along with scale_fill_identity()2. theme_void() is used here to remove all axes, margins around the plot, etc.2 scale_fill_identity() ensures that the actual RGBT values in the RGB variable are used, rather than assigning colors to those values.\n\nggplot(data=img17,mapping=aes(x=x,y=y,fill=RGB)) + \n  geom_raster() +\n  scale_fill_identity() +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is evident here that the plotted image will be “stretched” to fill the shape of the plotting device (square here). This unwanted behavior can be avoided by setting aspect.ratio= in theme() to the ar value calculated above. Unwanted white space3 around the plot can be removed by eliminating the scale expansion with expansion().3 This space is not evident on the default white background of this webpage. Change to dark mode (slider in upper-right corner of the title bar) to see the white space.\n\nggplot(data=img17,mapping=aes(x=x,y=y,fill=RGB)) + \n  geom_raster() +\n  scale_fill_identity() +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(aspect.ratio=ar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 in Vaisvil et al. (2022) also had a letter “tag” to the left of the figure. Adding this is a bit of work. First, the letter can be added with annotate() using geom=\"text\" with the tag label in label= and x= at the smallest value (i.e.,-Inf) and y= at the largest value (i.e., Inf) to center the label on the very upper-left corner of the plot. An hjust= and vjust= of 1.5 will move the label down and to the left so that it is fully visible. To make room for this label the left-side plot margin must be increased (from 0, the default in theme_void()), the aspect ratio must be adjusted slightly,4 and coord_cartesian(clip=\"off\") must be used so that the label is not “clipped” because it is outside the plot region.4 I am not sure how to automatically modify the aspect ratio to adjust for the width of the letter. In this example I used trial-and-error to increase it by 5% (i.e., multiplying ar by 1.05).\n\neb17 <- ggplot(data=img17,mapping=aes(x=x,y=y,fill=RGB)) + \n  geom_raster() +\n  scale_fill_identity() +\n  annotate(geom=\"text\",label=\"A\",x=-Inf,y=Inf,\n           hjust=1.5,vjust=1.5,size=5) +\n  coord_cartesian(clip=\"off\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(plot.margin=margin(l=5,unit=\"mm\"),\n        aspect.ratio=1.05*ar)\neb17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above is assigned to the eb17 object for later use. I created a similar object for the 2018 image.55 Called eb18, but code not shown.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlotting Water Level Fluctuations\n\nWater Fluctuation Data\nThe two right panels of Figure 4 in Vaisvil et al. (2022) are line plots that show the daily rate of change in water levels by day for each year, with the beginning and ending hatch dates for the bass highlighted. The data to construct this plot for both years were provided in JFWM-21-071.S3.csv from Supplement S3 with the published paper. One of the cells in the rate of change variable shows as “#REF!”, which implies a formula error in when I suspect was the original Excel file. I decided to treat this as missing data and thus needed to include the na= code in read.csv() below. I also immediately changed most of the variable names to be more concise.\n\ndfroc <- read.csv(\"JFWM-21-071.S3.csv\",na=c(\"\",\"#REF!\")) |>\n  select(date=Date_Time,\n         storage=Storage..km.3.,\n         elev=Elevation..m.,\n         roc=Rate.of.Change..cm.)\n\nThe date variable is appropriately read in as a character variable and, thus, needs to be converted to a “date” type for plotting. Unfortunately, the date data were not all recorded in the same format; some “dates” included “0:00”, whereas others did not, as shown below.\n\nFSA::headtail(dfroc)\n\n#R|               date   storage     elev    roc\n#R|  1   1/1/2017 0:00 0.2514777 1314.295 5.4864\n#R|  2   1/2/2017 0:00 0.2531534 1314.349 5.4864\n#R|  3   1/3/2017 0:00 0.2548389 1314.404 6.0960\n#R|  726    12/29/2018 0.1396767 1310.006 4.5720\n#R|  727    12/30/2018 0.1406878 1310.052 4.2672\n#R|  728    12/31/2018 0.1416372 1310.094 6.0960\n\n\nTo address this I used word() from stringr which finds each “word” (i.e., separated by a space) in a string. If the second argument to word() is set to 1 then it will return the first “word”, in this case just the date without the “0:00”. mdy() from lubridate was then used to convert date to a proper date variable and year() from lubridate was used to create a new variable that was just the year.\n\ndfroc <- dfroc |>\n  mutate(date=stringr::word(date,1),\n         date=lubridate::mdy(date),\n         yr=lubridate::year(date))\nFSA::headtail(dfroc)\n\n#R|            date   storage     elev    roc   yr\n#R|  1   2017-01-01 0.2514777 1314.295 5.4864 2017\n#R|  2   2017-01-02 0.2531534 1314.349 5.4864 2017\n#R|  3   2017-01-03 0.2548389 1314.404 6.0960 2017\n#R|  726 2018-12-29 0.1396767 1310.006 4.5720 2018\n#R|  727 2018-12-30 0.1406878 1310.052 4.2672 2018\n#R|  728 2018-12-31 0.1416372 1310.094 6.0960 2018\n\n\nFinally, separate data frames for 2017 and 2018 were created.\n\ndfroc17 <- dfroc |>\n  filter(yr==2017)\ndfroc18 <- dfroc |>\n  filter(yr==2018)\n\n \n\n\nBass Hatching Data\nHatching dates for individual bass were recorded and provided in JFWM-21-071.S2.csv from Supplement S2 with the published paper. There were no issues with these data so I simply made the variable names more concise and converted the dates to a proper date variable similar to above.\n\ndfhat <- read.csv(\"JFWM-21-071.S2.csv\") |>\n  select(id=FISH.ID,\n         yr=Year,\n         date=Hatch_date) |>\n  mutate(date=lubridate::mdy(date))\nFSA::headtail(dfhat)\n\n#R|     id   yr       date\n#R|  1   2 2018 2018-04-13\n#R|  2   3 2018 2018-04-18\n#R|  3   5 2018 2018-04-27\n#R|  62 82 2017 2017-05-05\n#R|  63 83 2017 2017-04-25\n#R|  64 84 2017 2017-05-07\n\n\nFigure 4 in Vaisvil et al. (2022) requires the earliest and latest hatch dates for each year, which are compute below and then separated by year.\n\ndfhatsum <- dfhat |>\n  group_by(yr) |>\n  summarize(minhat=min(date),\n            maxhat=max(date))\ndfhatsum\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 2 × 3\n#R|       yr minhat     maxhat    \n#R|    <int> <date>     <date>    \n#R|  1  2017 2017-04-14 2017-05-29\n#R|  2  2018 2018-04-13 2018-05-28\n\n\n\ndfhatsum17 <- dfhatsum |>\n  filter(yr==2017)\ndfhatsum18 <- dfhatsum |>\n  filter(yr==2018)\n\n \n\n\nGraphing Water Fluctuations\nBoth water fluctuation graphs in Figure 4 in Vaisvil et al. (2022) have the same y-axis range and breaks, based on the range of the data in both years combined. Those limits are computed below from the combined data frame.\n\n( lmts <- range(dfroc$roc,na.rm=TRUE) )\n\n#R|  [1] -18.2880  22.5552\n\nbrks <- seq(-15,20,5)\n\nThe code below creates the water fluctuations plot for 2017. There are four main parts to this code. First, ggplot() and geom_line() are used to plot the rate of change versus date as a line, which was made slightly larger with linewidth= to match Figure 4. Second, two geom_vline()s are used to mark the beginning and end hatch dates (as computed above) and geom_hline() is used to place a reference line at a rate of change of 0. Third, the axes are more specifically defined. The x-axis is defined with scale_x_date() using breaks=breaks_width(\"month\") to show a break at each month and labels=label_date(\"%b\") to use character abbreviations for those months as described in this post. Fourth, the black-and-white theme is applied, the title for the x-axis is removed, and the gridlines on the plot are removed.\n\nroc17 <- ggplot(data=dfroc17,mapping=aes(x=date,y=roc)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth=1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=dfhatsum17$minhat,linetype=\"dashed\",linewidth=1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=dfhatsum17$maxhat,linetype=\"dashed\",linewidth=1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype=\"dotted\",linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Rate-of-change (cm/d)\",expand=expansion(mult=0.01),\n                     limits=lmts,breaks=brks) +\n  scale_x_date(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n               breaks=breaks_width(\"month\"),labels=label_date(\"%b\")) +\n  theme_bw(base_size=14) +\n  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        panel.grid=element_blank())\nroc17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar code was used to construct a similar plot for the 2018 data.66 Called roc18, but code not shown.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRecreating Figure 4\nBefore Figure 4 can be recreated the x-axis labels must be removed from the water fluctuations plot for 2017.77 I would have done this originally, but I was illustrating above how to make a proper stand-alone plot for that year.\n\nroc17 <- roc17 +\n  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank())\n\nWith that, Figure 4 in Vaisvil et al.

    "text": "Introduction\nUlaski et al. (2022) modeled the White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) population in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin to suggest management goals for the population. Their Figure 1 showed a modeled von Bertalanffy growth function with shading below the curve that indicated the probability of being mature for each modeled age. I had not seen a plot like this before and set out to recreate it with ggplot2.\nThis exercise turned out to be more challenging than I thought and I ultimately reached out to Marta Ulaski, the lead author on the paper, to see if their solution was different or “easier” than mine. It was different but I learned something with both methods; thus, I will present both here.11 I modified the specifics but kept the overall concept of Ulaski’s approach.\n \n\n\nGetting Setup\nThe following packages are loaded for use below.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # for dplyr, ggplot2 packages\n\nThe ggplot2 theme was set to theme_bw() but with a larger base font size and gridlines removed.\n\ntheme_set(\n  theme_bw(base_size=14) +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank())\n)\n\n \n\nGrowth Function\nThe three parameters (\\(L_{\\infty}\\), \\(K\\), and \\(t_{0}\\)) of a “typical” von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) provided in the caption to Figure 1 of Ulaski et al. (2022) were entered into the vbpar named vector.\n\nvbpar <- c(\"Linf\"=380,\"K\"=0.027,\"to\"=-2.36)\n\nvbFuns() from FSA was used to create a function that returns the mean length-at-age given a set of ages and “typical” VBGF parameters.\n\nvb <- FSA::vbFuns('Typical')\nvb\n\n#R|  function (t, Linf, K = NULL, t0 = NULL) \n#R|  {\n#R|      if (length(Linf) == 3) {\n#R|          K <- Linf[[2]]\n#R|          t0 <- Linf[[3]]\n#R|          Linf <- Linf[[1]]\n#R|      }\n#R|      Linf * (1 - exp(-K * (t - t0)))\n#R|  }\n#R|  <bytecode: 0x000002744f2c7608>\n#R|  <environment: 0x000002744f244e70>\n\n\nWhile this function appears overly complicated, an advantage of this function is that all three parameters of the typical VBGF can be given to the Linf= argument.\nBelow is an illustrative example for computing the mean length-at-age given the parameters in vbpar for ages 10 and 15.\n\nvb(c(10,15),Linf=vbpar)\n\n#R|  [1] 107.8234 142.1949\n\n\nvb() will be used in both approaches to making Figure 1 below.\n \n\n\nMaturity Data\nUlaski et al. (2022) provided probabilities of being mature by age in their Table 1. Here I entered those data directly into a data frame, though I multiplied the probabilities by 100 as that is how they are presented in Figure 1. I also added a much older age of 50 to illustrate how this process could be extended to older ages than what was shown in their Figure 1.\n\ndfmat <- data.frame(age=c(0,10:20,50),\n                    prmat=c(0,0.025,0.086,0.143,0.291,0.543,\n                            0.622,0.788,0.849,0.942,0.966,1,1)*100)\ndfmat\n\n#R|     age prmat\n#R|  1    0   0.0\n#R|  2   10   2.5\n#R|  3   11   8.6\n#R|  4   12  14.3\n#R|  5   13  29.1\n#R|  6   14  54.3\n#R|  7   15  62.2\n#R|  8   16  78.8\n#R|  9   17  84.9\n#R|  10  18  94.2\n#R|  11  19  96.6\n#R|  12  20 100.0\n#R|  13  50 100.0\n\n\nThe probabilities presented in Figure 1 have been binned into categories. The first category is simply 0% (none mature), but each category after that has a width of 10%. Thus, the next two categories would be from 0.1 to 10%, and 10.1 to 20%. Ulaski et al. (2022) chose to label these two categories as “0-10%” and “10-20%”, respectively.\nThese categories may be created with cut(), which takes the data to categorize as its first argument, the values at which to “cut” the categories in breaks=, and labels for the categories in labels=. It is important to note that cut() makes categories right-inclusive by default. Thus, if the breaks are c(0,10,20) then the first category would be from 0 to 10, with 10 being inclusive. Thus, a value of 9 or 10 would be included in this category, but 0 would not. Thus, to have a category for just the 0 values, the breaks must start at some negative number (in this case, negative infinity was used).2 The results of cut() were added to the prcuts variable in dfmat.32 seq(0,100,10) creates a sequence from 0 to 100 in steps of 10.3 Because using mutate().\n\ndfmat <- dfmat |>\n  mutate(prcuts=cut(prmat,\n                    breaks=c(-Inf,seq(0,100,10)),\n                    labels=c(\"0%\",\"0-10%\",\"10-20%\",\"20-30%\",\"30-40%\",\"40-50%\",\n                             \"50-60%\",\"60-70%\",\"70-80%\",\"80-90%\",\"90-100%\")))\ndfmat\n\n#R|     age prmat  prcuts\n#R|  1    0   0.0      0%\n#R|  2   10   2.5   0-10%\n#R|  3   11   8.6   0-10%\n#R|  4   12  14.3  10-20%\n#R|  5   13  29.1  20-30%\n#R|  6   14  54.3  50-60%\n#R|  7   15  62.2  60-70%\n#R|  8   16  78.8  70-80%\n#R|  9   17  84.9  80-90%\n#R|  10  18  94.2 90-100%\n#R|  11  19  96.6 90-100%\n#R|  12  20 100.0 90-100%\n#R|  13  50 100.0 90-100%\n\n\ndfmat will be used in both approaches to making Figure 1 below.\n \n\n\nDefine Repetitive Values\nFor simplicity, some values that will be used in both approaches were assigned to objects that can be reused.\n\n# x-axis (age) title, limits, labels\nagettl <- \"Age (yrs)\"\nagelmts <- c(0,20)\nagelbls <- 0:20\n# y-axis (length) title, limits, labels\nlenttl <- \"Length (cm)\"\nlenlmts <- c(0,200)\nlenlbls <- seq(0,200,50)\n# fill color (probability mature) title\nprobttl <- \"Probability\"\n\n \n\n\n\nMy Recreation of Figure 1\n\nPlotting the von B function\nThe typical VBGF can be plotted over the range of ages in a data frame with stat_function().4 The function to be evaluated (i.e., vb()) is given in fun= and any arguments that it requires are given in a list to args=.5 The smoothness of the curve can be controlled with n=, which is the number of ages over the range of ages for which the function will be evaluated.6 Finally, I increased the line width slightly.4 Make sure to map the age variable to the x aesthetic.5 Here we can set vbpar to just Linf given that all parameters can be given to this one argument as shown above.6 n= defaults to 101, which appeared adequate for these data, though I increased it here to demonstrate its use.\n\nggplot(data=dfmat,mapping=aes(x=age)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=agettl,limits=agelmts,breaks=agelbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=lenttl,limits=lenlmts,breaks=lenlbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=vbpar),\n                n=202,linewidth=0.75)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen above, stat_function() defaults to drawing a line of the function (i.e., it uses geom_line()). However, other geoms can be used; e.g., geom=\"area\".77 I used fill= here to show the effect, but this also required setting color= because the color for the line took on the fill color.\n\nggplot(data=data.frame(age=c(0,20)),mapping=aes(x=age)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=agettl,limits=agelmts,breaks=agelbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=lenttl,limits=lenlmts,breaks=lenlbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=vbpar),\n                n=202,linewidth=0.75,\n                geom=\"area\",fill=\"salmon\",color=\"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdding the Maturity Scale\nMy solutions to recreating Figure 1 of Ulaski et al. (2022) generally followed the StackOverflow answer at the bottom of this question. This process uses after_stat() and after_scale(), which were introduced to ggplot2 in v3.3.0.8 I don’t yet fully understand these two functions, but will try to explain what I think they are doing.8 See their introduction here.\nAs illustrated above, stat_function() produces a smooth curve by creating n= values of x over the range of the variable mapped to the x= aesthetic. One part of the “trick” to this solution is to first realize that these “age” values created by stat_function() are not integers and, thus, they need to be “cut” into integer age categories. The second part of the “trick” to this solution is that the probability of maturity category labels should be used for the “cuts” of age rather than labels of age. For example, an age of 13.5 created by stat_function() should be categorized as an age of 13 but labeled with “20-30%”.9 This cutting of the age values comes after they have been created by stat_function() in the x= aesthetic and are thus accessed by after_stat(x) which I pipe into cut() and set equal to the fill= aesthetic in stat_function().9 Examine dfmat to see why.\nThe third part of the “trick” to this solution is to realize that the different colored areas can only be plotted if the group= aesthetic is set to the same categories used in the fill= aesthetic. As the fill= aesthetic was just created and is defined in a scale (see scale_fill_viridis_d() below), the group= aesthetic must be defined with after_scale(fill).\n\nggplot(data=dfmat,mapping=aes(x=age)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=agettl,limits=agelmts,breaks=agelbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=lenttl,limits=lenlmts,breaks=lenlbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  stat_function(mapping=aes(fill=after_stat(x) |>\n                              cut(breaks=!!dfmat$age,\n                                  labels=!!dfmat$prcuts[-nrow(dfmat)],\n                                  include.lowest=TRUE),\n                            group=after_scale(fill)),\n                fun=vb,args=list(Linf=vbpar),n=202,\n                geom=\"area\",color=\"black\",linewidth=0.75)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis, obviously, is not ideal … largely due to the long name for the legend. However, it is also not the colors used in Figure 1 of Ulaski et al. (2022). A custom viridis-based color scheme was used in Ulaski et al. (2022),10 which can be used with scale_fill_viridis_d().10 I would not have “discovered” this color scheme on my own. This came from seeing Ulaski’s original code.\n\nggplot(data=dfmat,mapping=aes(x=age)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=agettl,limits=agelmts,breaks=agelbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=lenttl,limits=lenlmts,breaks=lenlbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  stat_function(mapping=aes(fill=after_stat(x) |>\n                              cut(breaks=!!dfmat$age,\n                                  labels=!!dfmat$prcuts[-nrow(dfmat)],\n                                  include.lowest=TRUE),\n                            group=after_scale(fill)),\n                fun=vb,args=list(Linf=vbpar),n=202,\n                geom=\"area\",color=\"black\",linewidth=0.75) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name=probttl,begin=0.85,end=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, there are two things with this plot that I don’t like. First, the black line for the growth function appears broken at the color breaks. Second, the linewidth around the colors in the legend is too thick. To correct these issues, I removed linewidth= and color= from stat_function() and then added a second stat_function() that plots just the growth function as a line.11 This second use of stat_function() lays the function line on top of the function “area.”11 See the first use of stat_function() further above for how this was done.\n\nggplot(data=dfmat,mapping=aes(x=age)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=agettl,limits=agelmts,breaks=agelbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=lenttl,limits=lenlmts,breaks=lenlbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  stat_function(mapping=aes(fill=after_stat(x) |>\n                              cut(breaks=!!dfmat$age,\n                                  labels=!!dfmat$prcuts[-nrow(dfmat)],\n                                  include.lowest=TRUE),\n                            group=after_scale(fill)),\n                fun=vb,args=list(Linf=vbpar),n=202,\n                geom=\"area\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name=probttl,begin=0.85,end=0) +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=vbpar),n=202,\n                color=\"black\",linewidth=0.75)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Updates?\n\n\n\nI may update this post as I learn more about after_stat() and after_scale().\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAuthor’s Creation of Figure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgment\n\n\n\nThe solution in this section follows the concept of the code provided to me by Marta Ulaski, the lead author on the original paper. I have modified the specific code to better fit the rest of the post. I thank Marta for generously providing her source code and allowing me to modify it for presentation here.\n\n\n \n\nMaking the Data Frame\nUlaski’s solution to making this figure is much simpler to explain (Thank you!) but relies on explicitly creating a data frame that is largely what stat_function() did behind-the-scenes. Specifically, Ulaski created a data frame that repeated the probability of being mature for all ages in increments of 0.1. So, for example, this data frame contained an age of 12.3 with the probability of being mature being the same as that for age 12. To generalize this solution I set out to see if I could create this data frame from the simple dfmat created above.1212 Ulaski had manually created a CSV with these repeated data, which were read in to a data frame.\nRecall what the original dfmat looked like … ages and probabilities of maturity from Table 1 in the published paper, and categories of probability mature created with cut().\n\ndfmat\n\n#R|     age prmat  prcuts\n#R|  1    0   0.0      0%\n#R|  2   10   2.5   0-10%\n#R|  3   11   8.6   0-10%\n#R|  4   12  14.3  10-20%\n#R|  5   13  29.1  20-30%\n#R|  6   14  54.3  50-60%\n#R|  7   15  62.2  60-70%\n#R|  8   16  78.8  70-80%\n#R|  9   17  84.9  80-90%\n#R|  10  18  94.2 90-100%\n#R|  11  19  96.6 90-100%\n#R|  12  20 100.0 90-100%\n#R|  13  50 100.0 90-100%\n\n\nA new data frame is created that has fractional ages that begin at the minimum age in dfmat, end at the maximum age in dfmat, and uses a constant increment (0.1 in this example). lencat() from FSA is then used to create categories of ages that match the ages in dfmat. lencat() returns a factor variable by default but as.fact=FALSE causes it to return a number to match the age variable in dfmat.\n\ndfmat2 <- data.frame(agef=seq(min(dfmat$age),max(dfmat$age),0.1)) |>\n  mutate(age=FSA::lencat(agef,breaks=dfmat$age,as.fact=FALSE))\nFSA::headtail(dfmat2,n=5)\n\n#R|      agef age\n#R|  1    0.0   0\n#R|  2    0.1   0\n#R|  3    0.2   0\n#R|  4    0.3   0\n#R|  5    0.4   0\n#R|  497 49.6  20\n#R|  498 49.7  20\n#R|  499 49.8  20\n#R|  500 49.9  20\n#R|  501 50.0  50\n\n\nThe probability mature values and categories are added to this data frame with left_join() using the common age variable in dfmat and dfmat2.\n\ndfmat2 <- dfmat2 |>\n  left_join(dfmat,by=\"age\")\nFSA::headtail(dfmat2,n=5)\n\n#R|      agef age prmat  prcuts\n#R|  1    0.0   0     0      0%\n#R|  2    0.1   0     0      0%\n#R|  3    0.2   0     0      0%\n#R|  4    0.3   0     0      0%\n#R|  5    0.4   0     0      0%\n#R|  497 49.6  20   100 90-100%\n#R|  498 49.7  20   100 90-100%\n#R|  499 49.8  20   100 90-100%\n#R|  500 49.9  20   100 90-100%\n#R|  501 50.0  50   100 90-100%\n\n\nFinally, the predicted mean lengths are added using vb() as before.\n\ndfmat2 <- dfmat2 |>\n  mutate(len=vb(agef,Linf=vbpar))\nFSA::headtail(dfmat2)\n\n#R|      agef age prmat  prcuts       len\n#R|  1    0.0   0     0      0%  23.45828\n#R|  2    0.1   0     0      0%  24.41965\n#R|  3    0.2   0     0      0%  25.37842\n#R|  499 49.8  20   100 90-100% 287.06956\n#R|  500 49.9  20   100 90-100% 287.32013\n#R|  501 50.0  50   100 90-100% 287.57003\n\n\nThese steps can be combined into one tight set of code as shown below.\n\ndfmat2 <- data.frame(agef=seq(min(dfmat$age),max(dfmat$age),0.1)) |>\n  mutate(age=FSA::lencat(agef,breaks=dfmat$age,as.fact=FALSE)) |>\n  left_join(dfmat,by=\"age\") |>\n  mutate(len=vb(agef,Linf=vbpar))\n\n \n\n\nMaking the Figure\nFigure 1 is then created by mapping the fractional ages (i.e., agef) to x= and the lengths to y, mapping the probability cuts to fill= in geom_ares(), and including geom_line() (with a slightly larger line width).1313 This will produce a warning because the data frame extends to age 50 but the figure is limited to age 20.\n\nggplot(data=dfmat2,mapping=aes(x=agef,y=len)) + \n  geom_area(mapping=aes(fill=prcuts)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth=0.75) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=agettl,limits=agelmts,breaks=agelbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=lenttl,limits=lenlmts,breaks=lenlbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name=\"Probability\",begin=0.85,end=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFurther Thoughts\nThere are a few things that I would like to see different in this figure. First, the “white” lines between the colors are too prominent. The size of these lines are a function of the number of “fractional” ages used to produce the plot. Thus, to make these “lines” thinner one could increase n= in my solution or decrease by= in the author’s solution.\nSecond, it bothers me that the colors for the probabilities seem equally spaced even though two categories are not represented in the data (e.g., 30-40% and 40-50%). In my mind, there should be a “jump” in colors at the ages where the probability jumps from 20-30% to 50-60% (i.e., between age-13 and age-14).14 I could not address this issue with my solution, but including drop=FALSE in scale_fill_viridis_d() fixed this in the author’s solution.14 This will be a common issue with maturity data as the probability of maturity often increases dramatically over a short range of lengths and, thus, one or very few ages.\nThird, the “line” does not look like a typical VBGF to me as these sturgeon are long-lived and grow so slowly that very little curvature and no asymptote is evident. In some situations is may be useful to extend the x-axis to older ages to better “see” the typical asymptotic growth of the VBGF.1515 This is not that useful here given the shape of the VBGF for this species.\nFinally, the authors started their plot at age-1. I am not sure why they did this, but that can be accomplished by filtering the data to only age-1 and older.\nAll of these changes (with by=0.05 and extending the ages to 30) were made below using the author’s solution.\n\nagelmts <- c(0,30)                               # changed max\nagelbls <- seq(0,30,2)                           # changed max, made sequence by 2\nlenlmts <- c(0,250)                              # changed max\nlenlbls <- seq(0,250,50)                         # changed max\n\nby <- 0.05                                       # made smaller\n\ndfmat3 <- data.frame(agef=seq(min(dfmat$age),max(dfmat$age),by)) |>\n  mutate(age=FSA::lencat(agef,breaks=dfmat$age,as.fact=FALSE)) |>\n  left_join(dfmat,by=\"age\") |>\n  mutate(len=vb(agef,Linf=vbpar)) |>\n  filter(agef>=1)                                # filtered out <age-1\n\nggplot(data=dfmat3,mapping=aes(x=agef,y=len)) +  # used new dfmat3\n  geom_area(mapping=aes(fill=prcuts)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth=0.75) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=agettl,limits=agelmts,breaks=agelbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=lenttl,limits=lenlmts,breaks=lenlbls,\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name=\"Probability\",begin=0.85,end=0,drop=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nUlaski, M.

The NA “color” means to use no color. Thus, the “0” label will be black, but the “5”, “10”, “15”, and “20” will have no color and, thus, will not be visible. Given the “recycling property discussed above this pattern will be repeated so that the”25” is black but then “30” to “45” will have no color, “50” will be black, etc.1312 This “trick” came from this StackOverflow answer.13 Make sure you note below that the breaks were set to a sequence with an interval of 5.\n\ndemo_continuous(c(0,100)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,by=5)) +\n  theme(axis.ticks.length=unit(5,units=\"pt\"),\n        axis.text.x=element_text(color=c(\"black\",\"NA\",\"NA\",\"NA\",\"NA\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are times when it may be easier to use rep() to repeat the required NA values.

Alternatively, %m/%d/%Y indicates that the dates are in numeric month, numeric day, and four-digit year all separated by forward slashes format (e.g., “07/09/1967”)\nStrings can be converted to dates with as.Date(), with the string as the first argument and a string that describes the date format in format=.

For example, in the example above it may not be necessary to include the year, and it may be preferred to use the month abbreviations. The format of date labels is controlled with labels= using label_date() to format the date with codes as defined above. The example below shows the month abbreviation and day only.\n\ndemo_date(c(\"1-May-2020\",\"31-May-2020\")) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks=as.Date(c(\"1-May-2020\",\"8-May-2020\",\"15-May-2020\",\n                                \"22-May-2020\",\"29-May-2020\"),format=\"%d-%b-%Y\"),\n               labels=label_date(\"%b %d\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting the breaks with a vector of all breaks can be tedious. However, breaks_width= introduced above can be used to set breaks with key words. For example, date_breaks=\"week\" sets breaks at every week.\n\ndemo_date(c(\"1-May-2020\",\"31-May-2020\")) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks=breaks_width(\"week\"),\n               labels=label_date(\"%b %d\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf these dates don’t start on your preferred date then use offset= to “move” the starting data. Here I wanted the dates to start on “May-01” rather than “May-04” so I moved the dates forward by three days with offset=-3.\n\ndemo_date(c(\"1-May-2020\",\"31-May-2020\")) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks=breaks_width(\"week\",offset=-3),\n               labels=label_date(\"%b %d\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndemo_date(c(\"1-May-2020\",\"31-May-2020\")) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks=breaks_width(\"2 weeks\",offset=-10),\n               labels=label_date(\"%b %d\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther key words for breaks_width= include day, month, and year.21 For example, the approximate year example from above gets monthly breaks below.2221 And also sec, min, and hour for time data.22 And are labeled with the month abbreviation and the year without the century.\n\ndemo_date(c(\"1-May-2020\",\"30-Apr-2021\")) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks=breaks_width(\"month\"),\n               labels=label_date(\"%b %y\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbreaks_width() is particularly powerful because any of the key words can be made plural and then a number added in front of it to make breaks at those intervals. For example, the example immediately above is modified below to have breaks every three months.\n\ndemo_date(c(\"1-May-2020\",\"30-Apr-2021\")) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks=breaks_width(\"3 months\"),\n               labels=label_date(\"%b %y\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, these breaks may not start where you want them to. Here offset= can be used as above but you can include keyword units. For example, the starting break is moved two months earlier below.\n\ndemo_date(c(\"1-May-2020\",\"30-Apr-2021\")) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks=breaks_width(\"3 months\",offset=\"-2 months\"),\n               labels=label_date(\"%b %y\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinor ticks can be added using these same strategies along with the methods from ggh4x shown above.\n\ndemo_date(c(\"1-May-2020\",\"30-Apr-2021\")) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks=breaks_width(\"3 months\",offset=\"-2 months\"),\n               minor_breaks=breaks_width(\"1 months\",offset=\"-2 months\"),\n               labels=label_date(\"%b %y\"),\n               guide=\"axis_minor\") +\n  theme(axis.ticks.length.x=unit(10,unit=\"pt\"),\n        ggh4x.axis.ticks.length.minor=rel(0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTick marks for a dates axis are modified in this post, this post, and this post."

First, “Cisco” are sometimes called “Herring”, so both of these “species” must be retained. Deepwater ciscoes are often called “chubs”, so this “species” must be retained. However, there were also “species” called various versions of “Cisco and Chubs”, all of which need to be retained. A new data frame is created below with just these “species” and, to match Rook et al.

Thus, an adjustment will be made below for these NAs when summing to make a composite harvest value for each year and lake.\n\nany(is.na(cdat$Total))\n\n#R|  [1] TRUE\n\n\nA new data frame is created from the data frame above that groups the data by Year within Lake and then sums the Total harvest for all “species” in each lake-year combination into a variable called Coregonids. na.rm=TRUE is used in sum to ignore the NAs.3 The data frame is ungroup()ed before moving on.3 Otherwise, any sum with an NA value will return NA.\n\ncdat2 <- cdat |>\n  group_by(Lake,Year) |>\n  summarize(Coregonids=sum(Total,na.rm=TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup()\nFSA::peek(cdat2,n=10)\n\n#R|             Lake Year Coregonids\n#R|  1          Erie 1880    882.000\n#R|  75         Erie 1954    381.000\n#R|  150       Huron 1927   7694.000\n#R|  225       Huron 2002    118.622\n#R|  300    Michigan 1951  18675.000\n#R|  375     Ontario 1890   3084.000\n#R|  450     Ontario 1965     31.000\n#R|  525 Saint Clair 1904     27.000\n#R|  600    Superior 1940  36879.000\n#R|  675    Superior 2015   2070.797\n\n\nIt was not obvious to me from the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission website what the units are for these harvest data. In comparison to Rook et al. (2022) they appear to be hundreds of thousands of pounds. Rook et al. (2022) plotted millions of kgs so I first convert Coregonids to kg and then divide by 1000 to get to millions of kgs.\n\ncdat2 <- cdat2 |>\n  mutate(Coregonids=Coregonids*0.45359237,\n         Coregonids=Coregonids/1000)\n\nAn issue that happens regularly with these type of data with this type of plot occurs when the data does not have continuous years. For example, suppose that harvest was recorded for 1900 and 1902 but not 1901. If 1901 is completely excluded from the data, rather than being entered as an NA, then the line in the plot will connect directly from 1900 to 1902 suggesting, if the reader is not paying close attention, that a value exists in 1901. You can see many unconnected dots in Figure 2 of Rook et al. (2022) that illustrate how these missing data should be handled.\nWith these data, it appears that the years are contiguous within each lake except for Lake Erie, but only complete (for 1880-2015) for lakes Huron, Ontario, and Superior.\n\ncdat2 |>\n  group_by(Lake) |>\n  summarize(numYrs=n(),\n            minYr=min(Year),\n            maxYr=max(Year),\n            rngYr=maxYr-minYr+1,\n            contigYr=ifelse(rngYr==numYrs,\"Yes\",\"No\"),\n            compltYr=ifelse(numYrs==(2015-1880+1),\"Yes\",\"No\"))\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 6 × 7\n#R|    Lake        numYrs minYr maxYr rngYr contigYr compltYr\n#R|    <chr>        <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>    <chr>   \n#R|  1 Erie           102  1880  2015   136 No       No      \n#R|  2 Huron          136  1880  2015   136 Yes      Yes     \n#R|  3 Michigan       126  1890  2015   126 Yes      No      \n#R|  4 Ontario        136  1880  2015   136 Yes      Yes     \n#R|  5 Saint Clair     39  1880  1918    39 Yes      No      \n#R|  6 Superior       136  1880  2015   136 Yes      Yes\n\n\nThe issue with Lake Erie appears to be many years of missing data from 1977 to 2012.\n\ntmp <- cdat2 |>\n  filter(Lake==\"Erie\")\ntmp$Year\n\n#R|    [1] 1880 1881 1882 1883 1884 1885 1886 1887 1888 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894\n#R|   [16] 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909\n#R|   [31] 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 1919 1920 1921 1922 1923 1924\n#R|   [46] 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939\n#R|   [61] 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954\n#R|   [76] 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969\n#R|   [91] 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 2012 2013 2014 2015\n\n\nTo make sure that the data are contiguous and cover the range of years, expand_grid() was used first to create a temporary data frame with each year from 1880 to 2015 (inclusive) listed for each lake.\n\ntmp <- expand_grid(Lake=unique(cdat2$Lake),\n                   Year=min(cdat2$Year):max(cdat2$Year))\n\nFSA::headtail(tmp)\n\n#R|          Lake Year\n#R|  1       Erie 1880\n#R|  2       Erie 1881\n#R|  3       Erie 1882\n#R|  814 Superior 2013\n#R|  815 Superior 2014\n#R|  816 Superior 2015\n\n\nThis data frame was left_join() with cdat2, using both Lake and Year as the id variables, so that every lake-year combination in tmp was matched with a Total from the corresponding lake-year combination in cdat2 or an NA if the lake-year combination did not exist in cdat2.\n\ncdat3 <- left_join(tmp,cdat2,by=c(\"Lake\",\"Year\"))\n\nNow the years are contiguous and complete for each lake.\n\ncdat3 |>\n  group_by(Lake) |>\n  summarize(numYrs=n(),\n            minYr=min(Year),\n            maxYr=max(Year),\n            rngYr=maxYr-minYr+1,\n            contigYr=ifelse(rngYr==numYrs,\"Yes\",\"No\"),\n            compltYr=ifelse(numYrs==(2015-1880+1),\"Yes\",\"No\"))\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 6 × 7\n#R|    Lake        numYrs minYr maxYr rngYr contigYr compltYr\n#R|    <chr>        <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>    <chr>   \n#R|  1 Erie           136  1880  2015   136 Yes      Yes     \n#R|  2 Huron          136  1880  2015   136 Yes      Yes     \n#R|  3 Michigan       136  1880  2015   136 Yes      Yes     \n#R|  4 Ontario        136  1880  2015   136 Yes      Yes     \n#R|  5 Saint Clair    136  1880  2015   136 Yes      Yes     \n#R|  6 Superior       136  1880  2015   136 Yes      Yes\n\n\nFinally, Lake is made a factor with the levels specified so that the lakes will be ordered as in Figure 2 of Rook et al. (2022)\n\ncdat3 <- cdat3 |>\n  mutate(Lake=factor(Lake,levels=c(\"Superior\",\"Huron\",\"Michigan\",\n                                   \"Erie\",\"Ontario\",\"Saint Clair\")))\n\nAs will be shown further below, these data do not appear to be exactly the data used in Rook et al. (2022). One of several issues that is evident is that their Figure 2 shows many years of missing data (i.e., points not connected with lines) early in the time series for most lakes, whereas there were few missing years in my data frame. I suspected that Rook et al. (2022) may have coded a harvest of 0 as NA so, to explore this, I created a new variable called is0 that I will plot differently further below. I did this only to troubleshoot this data issue, not as part of recreating their Figure 2.\n\ncdat3 <- cdat3 |>\n  mutate(is0=Coregonids==0)\n\n \n\n\nRecreating Figure 2\nThe ggplot2 theme was set to theme_classic() but with modifications to remove the background for facet labels, increase the spacing between facets, remove the legend,4 make tick marks slightly longer, and make minor tick marks 50% as big as the major tick marks.54 The only reason there is a legend is because I am going to highlight points where the harvest was 0.5 This requires the ggh4x package attached above.\n\ntheme_set(\n  theme_classic() +\n    theme(strip.background=element_blank(),\n          panel.spacing=unit(5,\"mm\"),\n          legend.position=\"none\",\n          axis.ticks.length.x=unit(5,units=\"pt\"),\n          ggh4x.axis.ticks.length.minor=rel(0.5)))\n\nI could not find a simple way to have minor ticks, ticks that crossed the axes, and differing y-axis limits for each facet as used in Figure 2 of Rook et al. (2022). Thus, I opted to not have ticks that crossed the axes.\nA basic plot is constructed below from cdat3 with Year mapped to the x-axis and Coregonids mapped to the y-axis with geom_line() and geom_point() to plot the line with points. facet_wrap() was used to separate the plots by lake. In facet_wrap() both scales were “freed” because the y-axes need to change by lake and, though the x-axes don’t differ by lake, freeing the x-axes will force an x-axis to be shown for each lake as in Rook et al. (2022). is0 is mapped to a color in geom_point(), and the colors are defined in scale_color_manual(), to show years that had 0 harvest as red.&(Again, this is not in Rook et al. 2022, but I was trying to better understand why my data appeared different than theirs.)\n\nggplot(data=cdat3,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Coregonids)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=is0),size=1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Lake),scales=\"free\",ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome challenges remain to try to match Figure 2 in Rook et al. (2022). First, the x-axes need to be bound from 1880 to 2020, the tick mark labels need to be shown at intervals of 20 years, and minor ticks need to be shown at 5 year intervals. The axes bounds are set with limits=, major (i.e., labeled) breaks are set with breaks= using breaks_width(),6 and minor breaks are set with minor_breaks= also using breaks_width().7 Note the use of guide= so that the minor breaks will be shown.6 breaks_width() requires the scales package attached above.7 As described in this post.\n\nggplot(data=cdat3,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Coregonids)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=is0),size=1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1880,2020),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=breaks_width(20),\n                     minor_breaks=breaks_width(5),guide=\"axis_minor\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Lake),scales=\"free\",ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the y-axes need a different label and different upper limits, major tick labels, and minor ticks per facet/panel. All of these items may be adjusted on a per-facet basis with facetted_pos_scales() which is described in more detail in this post. For these purposes, y= in facetted_pos_scales() will receive a list with as many scale_y_continuous() items in it as facets (i.e., six). Each scale_y_continuous() item in this list will define the y-axis for a facet, ordered across rows and down columns. For example, the first scale_y_continuous() item is for Lake Superior and the last is for Lake St. Clair. Note that the name for the y-axis only needs to be defined in the first scale_y_continous() item in the list.\n\nsyc <- list(\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Commercial Harvest (millions of kg)\",\n                     limits=c(0,20),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=breaks_width(5),minor_breaks=breaks_width(5/5),\n                     guide=\"axis_minor\"),\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,5),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=breaks_width(1),minor_breaks=breaks_width(1/5),\n                     guide=\"axis_minor\"),\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,15),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=breaks_width(5),minor_breaks=breaks_width(5/5),\n                     guide=\"axis_minor\"),\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,25),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=breaks_width(5),minor_breaks=breaks_width(5/5),\n                     guide=\"axis_minor\"),\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,2.5),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=breaks_width(0.5),minor_breaks=breaks_width(0.5/5),\n                     guide=\"axis_minor\"),\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,0.5),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=breaks_width(0.1),minor_breaks=breaks_width(0.1/5),\n                     guide=\"axis_minor\")\n  )\n\nFor convenience the list was entered into an object above and given to facetted_pos_scale() below.\n\nggplot(data=cdat3,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Coregonids)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=is0),size=1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1880,2020),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=breaks_width(20),\n                     minor_breaks=breaks_width(5),guide=\"axis_minor\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Lake),scales=\"free\",ncol=2) +\n  facetted_pos_scales(y=syc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, Rook et al. (2022) placed the lake labels in the upper-right corner of each facet rather than centered above each facet. To accomplish this use geom_text() with Lake mapped to a label. This will, by default, print the lake name for each facet over-and-over for as many rows as there are for the lake in the data frame. To eliminate these overlapping labels, include check_overlap=TRUE. The label position was set to the maximum x and maximum y value for each facet by using both x=Inf and y=Inf. The label was then moved left (with vjust=) and down (with hjust=) as described in this post. The font size was reduced from the default slightly. Finally, the default facet labels must be removed by setting strip.text= to element_blank() in theme().\n\nggplot(data=cdat3,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Coregonids)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(mapping=aes(color=is0),size=1) +\n  geom_text(mapping=aes(label=Lake),check_overlap=TRUE,size=3.5,\n            x=Inf,y=Inf,vjust=1.2,hjust=1.2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1880,2020),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=breaks_width(20),\n                     minor_breaks=breaks_width(5),guide=\"axis_minor\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Lake),scales=\"free\",ncol=2) +\n  facetted_pos_scales(y=syc) +\n  theme(strip.text=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis largely recreates Figure 2 in Rook et al. (2022) with the exceptions of (a) tick marks that do not cross the axes and (b) discrepancies in the data used.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nRook, B. J., M. J. Hansen, and C. R. Bronte. 2022.

Their Figure 4 shows lake-specific estimates of fry, fall fingerling, and age-1 stocking densities used to determine the number of Cisco (Coregonus artedi) needed for stocking to mimic historical and contemporary age-1 and adult recruitment rates in Wisconsin waters of Lake Superior. I attempt to recreate their figure here.\nThe following packages are loaded for use below.

    "text": "Preliminaries\nRook et al. (2022) used various shades of gray to identify the time-stage (i.e., Stage) data in their Figure 4. The object below is a named vector with approximations to their color choices.\n\nsclrs <- c(\"Hist. Fry\"=\"gray20\",\"Hist. Fingerling\"=\"gray50\",\"Hist. Age-1\"=\"gray80\",\n           \"Cont. Fry\"=\"gray35\",\"Cont. Fingerling\"=\"gray65\",\"Cont. Age-1\"=\"gray95\")\n\nFigure 4 is a side-by-side bar chart with confidence intervals on each bar. Sided-by-side bars require “dodging” in ggplot2 (see below). The confidence intervals also need to be “dodged” to match the bars, but they will only match if the “dodging” is pre-defined. Dodging is defined with position_dodge() using width= to determine how much the side-by-side objects will overlap. A width= of 0 will result in complete overlap, whereas a width= of 1 results in no overlap with a slight separation between bars. A value of 0.9 resulted in no overlap but touching bars as used in Rook et al. (2022).\n\npd <- position_dodge(width=0.9)\n\nFinally, Rook et al. (2022) labeled each panel of their Figure 4 within the plot region, rather than as a “title” above the plot region. Thus, as in this previous post about Rook et al. (2022), the default facet labels cannot be used. An added challenge here though is that the labels they used contain plain text, italicized text, and a subscript. Thus, the “trick” used in that post cannot be easily used here.\nHere I create a very simple data frame with two variables. The first variable is Type which contains the two types of data found in dat. It is important that this variable is exactly as it is in dat (i.e., factored, levels the same) as this is the variable that is going to define the facets, or sub-panels, of Figure 4. The second variable, Label, contains the “long” labels for each panel. Here I use markdown code to create the italics (i.e., *) and the subscript (i.e., ~).44 These will be used in geom_richtext() from ggtext below, rather than plotmath which I find exceedingly difficult to get correct.\n\ndatlbls <- data.frame(Type=factor(c(\"Smax\",\"Rmax\"),levels=c(\"Smax\",\"Rmax\")),\n                      Label=c(\"Adult (*S~max~*) Equivalents\",\n                              \"Age-1 (*R~max~*) Equivalents\"))"

    "text": "Putting It Together\nThe basic bar plot is constructed from the summarized data in dat using geom_col() with Lake mapped to the x-axis, MEDIAN mapped to the y-axis, and Stage mapped to the fill= color. The bars will not be sided-by-side by default; they need to be “dodged” by setting postion= to the dodge position value set above. color= is set to black to outline each bar as in Rook et al. (2022). facet_wrap() is used to separate the plots by Type, with only one column used. The x-axis was “freed” so that the axis and labels would be shown in both facets as in Rook et al. (2022).\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Lake,y=MEDIAN,fill=Stage),\n           position=pd,color=\"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Type),ncol=1,scales=\"free_x\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence intervals are added with geom_errorbar() with Lake again mapped to the x-axis, L95 and U95 mapped to the minimum and maximum y interval values, and Stage set as a group.5 To match the bars the confidence intervals must be dodged in the same way with postion= and the “cap” on the interval was made smaller with width=.5 The data needs a group here to match the group created by fill= in geom_col().\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Lake,y=MEDIAN,fill=Stage),\n           position=pd,color=\"black\") +\n  geom_errorbar(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Lake,ymin=L95,ymax=U95,group=Stage),\n                position=pd,width=0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Type),ncol=1,scales=\"free_x\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColors were then set with scale_fill_manual() using the sclrs vector defined above. In addition, the y-axis was given a better title, the limits were set, axis expansion was removed, major breaks (i.e., labelled) were set at intervals of 200, and minor breaks were set at intervals of 100.66 These axis modifications were described in more detail in this post.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Lake,y=MEDIAN,fill=Stage),\n           position=pd,color=\"black\") +\n  geom_errorbar(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Lake,ymin=L95,ymax=U95,group=Stage),\n                position=pd,width=0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Type),ncol=1,scales=\"free_x\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=sclrs) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Stocking Density (fish/ha)\",\n                     limits=c(0,1800),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(200),\n                     minor_breaks=scales::breaks_width(100),\n                     guide=\"axis_minor\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabels are now added to the facets with geom_richtext() from the ggtext package. Here data= is set to datlbls, which is why data=dat was used in geom_col() and geom_errobar() rather than being set in ggplot().7 The Label in datlbls is mapped to the labels, but x= and y= are defined outside of the data frame. Specifically, x= is set to 3.5 because each category is listed behind the scenes with sequential numbers beginning at 1. With six categories on the x-axis, the center will be at 3.5. y= is set to Inf to generically be set at the largest y value plotted. Thus, the labels will be centered from left-to-right (x-axis orientation) and at the top (y-axis orientation). vjust= is used to move the label down slightly (see this post), label.color=NA removes the default box around the label, and size= was used to reduce the default size slightly.7 If multiple data frames are used when constructing a figure, then those data frames are usually declared in the geoms rather than in ggplot().\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Lake,y=MEDIAN,fill=Stage),\n           position=pd,color=\"black\") +\n  geom_errorbar(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Lake,ymin=L95,ymax=U95,group=Stage),\n                position=pd,width=0.5) +\n  ggtext::geom_richtext(dat=datlbls,mapping=aes(label=Label),x=3.5,y=Inf,\n                        vjust=0.9,label.color=NA,size=3.5) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Type),ncol=1,scales=\"free_x\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=sclrs) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Stocking Density (fish/ha)\",\n                     limits=c(0,1800),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(200),\n                     minor_breaks=scales::breaks_width(100),\n                     guide=\"axis_minor\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the theme was modified to more closely match Figure 4 in Rook et al. (2022). Specifically, theme_class() was used as the base and facet labels were removed, the x-axis title was removed, major tick mark size was increased, minor tick mark size was set to 50% of the major tick mark size, the legend was moved to the upper right of the plot, the legend title was removed, the legend text was made smaller, and the legend box size was made smaller.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Lake,y=MEDIAN,fill=Stage),\n           position=pd,color=\"black\") +\n  geom_errorbar(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Lake,ymin=L95,ymax=U95,group=Stage),\n                position=pd,width=0.5) +\n  ggtext::geom_richtext(dat=datlbls,mapping=aes(label=Label),x=3.5,y=Inf,\n                        vjust=0.9,label.color=NA,size=3.5) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(Type),ncol=1,scales=\"free_x\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=sclrs) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Stocking Density (fish/ha)\",\n                     limits=c(0,1800),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(200),\n                     minor_breaks=scales::breaks_width(100),\n                     guide=\"axis_minor\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(strip.text=element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.length=unit(5,units=\"pt\"),\n        ggh4x.axis.ticks.length.minor=rel(0.5),\n        legend.position=c(1,1),\n        legend.justification=c(1.05,0.95),\n        legend.title=element_blank(),\n        legend.text=element_text(size=7),\n        legend.key.size = unit(0.75,units=\"line\")\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis largely reproduces Figure 4 in Rook et al. (2022) with the exceptions that (a) the tick marks don’t cross the x-axes and (b) the x-axis tick marks are centered on the group of bars rather than between the group of bars."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Series Note\n\n\n\nThis is the first of several posts related to McCarrick et al. (2022).\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nMcCarrick et al. (2022) examined the population dynamics of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri) in Henrys Lake, Idaho over a nearly two decade period. Their Figure 2 shows the catch-per-unit-effort (CPE) of both Cutthroat Trout and Utah Chub (Gila atraria) by size categories across years. I use ggplot2 to recreate that figure here.\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. A few functions from each of lubridate, FSA, plyr, scales, gghrx, and lemon are used with :: such that the entire packages are not attached here.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # for dplyr, ggplot2 packages\nlibrary(patchwork)  # for arranging multiple plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will see below that I could recreate the structure but not the exact results of the author’s Figure 2. This may be due to issues present in the data provided with the publication that I discuss below, but it could also be that my data wrangling differs from theirs. I defer to the authors here as they are the experts with their day; I am just an interloper. I actually appreciate these data issues from an educational perspective as they provide rich opportunities to demonstrate a variety of techniques with “real” “messy” data.\n\n\n \n\n\nData Wrangling\n\nReading Excel File and Handling Dates\nMcCarrick et al. (2022) provided raw data for Figure 2 as an Excel file in their Data Supplement S1. Several “issues” were apparent on my first attempts to load these data.\n\nMissing data was recorded as missing cells, with “??”, and with “UNK”.\nThere were oddly placed strings in some data fields (e.g., “Qty=”, “Qty =”, and “No Tag”). [I treated these as missing data below.]\nDates were recorded as just year, full date with two-digit year, and full date with four-digit year. [More on this below.]\nInconsistent “species” abbreviations. [More on this below.]\nIncorrect length and weight measurements (e.g., <10 mm, >2000 mm). [I treated these “as is” (i.e., without correction) for this post.]\n\nThe missing data and oddly named cells were handled with na= below. In addition, the column types were specifically defined in col_types=, primarily so that the first column would be largely correctly read as a date. The year was then extracted from the Date variable using year() from lubridate. However, the dates recorded in the original file as only a year were interpreted as an “Excel date code” rather than a date and, thus, the year was not extracted correctly. Fortunately, this “date” format was only used for one year (2002) such that the extracted year was consistently “1905.” Thus, the “1905” was replaced with “2002” for the extracted year with ifelse() as shown below. Several years did not exist (because the date was not recorded) and were removed with filter(). Finally, the variables were rearranged slightly, Species was changed to species for consistency with other variables, and the long effort variable was changed to the shorter netNights.11 Note that this code still produced a large number of warnings, all related to the “2002” “date”.\n\ndat <- readxl::read_xlsx(\"download.xlsx\",\n                         na=c(\"\",\"??\",\"QTY =\",\"QTY=\",\"UNK\",\"NO TAG\"),\n                         col_types=c(\"date\",\"numeric\",\"text\",\n                                     \"numeric\",\"numeric\",\"text\")) |>\n  mutate(year=lubridate::year(Date),\n         year=ifelse(year==1905,2002,year)) |>\n  filter(!is.na(year)) |>\n  select(species=Species,year,length,weight,netNights=`number of net nights`)\nFSA::headtail(dat)\n\n#R|        species year length weight netNights\n#R|  1         YCT 2002    150     NA        18\n#R|  2         YCT 2002    160     NA        18\n#R|  3         YCT 2002    160     NA        18\n#R|  23971     YCT 2020    391    550        30\n#R|  23972     YCT 2020    284    229        30\n#R|  23973     YCT 2020    440    853        30\n\n\n\n\nNew Effort Data Frame\nThe effort (i.e., netNights) variable seems out-of-place in the sense that each row of this data frame is a single fish. I suspected that this effort is actually for a year and was repeated for each fish captured in the same year. To examine my suspicion, I computed the minimum and maximum effort (and the difference between the two) for each year.\n\ndat |>\n  group_by(year) |>\n  summarize(minF=min(netNights,na.rm=TRUE),\n            maxF=max(netNights,na.rm=TRUE),\n            diff=maxF-minF)\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 19 × 4\n#R|      year  minF  maxF  diff\n#R|     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n#R|   1  2002    18    18     0\n#R|   2  2003    18    18     0\n#R|   3  2004    50    50     0\n#R|   4  2005    46    46     0\n#R|   5  2006    48    48     0\n#R|   6  2007    44    44     0\n#R|   7  2008    12    12     0\n#R|   8  2009    23    23     0\n#R|   9  2010    50    50     0\n#R|  10  2011    30    30     0\n#R|  11  2012    50    50     0\n#R|  12  2013    50    50     0\n#R|  13  2014    48    48     0\n#R|  14  2015    50    50     0\n#R|  15  2016    48    48     0\n#R|  16  2017    50    50     0\n#R|  17  2018    50    50     0\n#R|  18  2019    50    50     0\n#R|  19  2020    30    50    20\n\n\nThe minimum and maximum efforts are the same for each, with the exception of 2020. I suspect that this is a typo. A quick table of efforts for 2020 shows that the vast majority are 30, rather than 50, net-nights. Further, my initial analysis with these data resulted in CPE values for 2020 that were lower than what was shown in McCarrick et al. (2022). Thus, I am going to assume that 30 net-nights of effort was used in 2020 (see how this is corrected below).\n\nxtabs(~netNights,data=filter(dat,year==2020))\n\n#R|  netNights\n#R|   30  50 \n#R|  865   9\n\n\nFor my purposes, I am going to create a new data frame of annual levels of effort by finding the minimum netNights in each year. The minimum is used here because it is the actual effort for all years that properly had a constant netNights entered and it is the assumed correct netNights for 2020 when a constant value was not entered.\n\neff <- dat |>\n  group_by(year) |>\n  summarize(netNights=min(netNights,na.rm=TRUE))\neff\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 19 × 2\n#R|      year netNights\n#R|     <dbl>     <dbl>\n#R|   1  2002        18\n#R|   2  2003        18\n#R|   3  2004        50\n#R|   4  2005        46\n#R|   5  2006        48\n#R|   6  2007        44\n#R|   7  2008        12\n#R|   8  2009        23\n#R|   9  2010        50\n#R|  10  2011        30\n#R|  11  2012        50\n#R|  12  2013        50\n#R|  13  2014        48\n#R|  14  2015        50\n#R|  15  2016        48\n#R|  16  2017        50\n#R|  17  2018        50\n#R|  18  2019        50\n#R|  19  2020        30\n\n\nThe netNights variables is no longer needed in the individual fish data frame.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  select(-netNights)\n\n\n\nFiltering to Two Species\nFigure 2 in McCarrick et al. (2022) only displays results for Cutthroat Trout and Utah Chub. Thus, the data frame should be reduced to just these species. First, a look at how species are identified.\n\nunique(dat$species)\n\n#R|   [1] \"YCT\"     \"BKT\"     \"HYB\"     \"CHB\"     \"RSS\"     \"UTC\"     \"KOK\"    \n#R|   [8] \"BRT\"     \"CHUB\"    NA        \"HB\"      \"Yct\"     \"NO FISH\" \"SCU\"\n\n\nFrom the published paper it is apparent that “YCT” is for Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and “UTC” is for Utah Chub. But note the “Yct” and the “CHB” and “CHUB”. A little closer look at just these abbreviations by year suggests that “Yct” is a “one-off” typo, but that “CHB” and “CHUB” appeared to be used in some years when “UTC” was mostly not used. This suggested to me that “CHB” and “CHUB” were likely synonyms for “UTC”.\n\nxtabs(~year+species,data=filter(dat,species %in% c(\"YCT\",\"Yct\",\"UTC\",\"CHB\",\"CHUB\")))\n\n#R|        species\n#R|  year    CHB CHUB  UTC  Yct  YCT\n#R|    2002    0    0    0    0   55\n#R|    2003   84    0    2    0  162\n#R|    2004    0    0  728    0  323\n#R|    2005    0    0  294    0  305\n#R|    2006    0    0  424    0  269\n#R|    2007    0    0  895    0  658\n#R|    2008    0  606    0    0  100\n#R|    2009    0    0  512    0   91\n#R|    2010    0    0    0    0  502\n#R|    2011    0  440    0    0  374\n#R|    2012    0    0  692    0  500\n#R|    2013    0    0 1858    0  478\n#R|    2014    0    0 1767    1  475\n#R|    2015    0    0 1660    0  254\n#R|    2016    0    0 1078    0  265\n#R|    2017    0    0 1025    0  149\n#R|    2018    0    0 1273    0   76\n#R|    2019    0    0  696    0  219\n#R|    2020    0    0  414    0  198\n\n\nThus, species is modified below by combining “YCT” and “Yct” into “YCT”, and combining “UTC”, “CHB”, and “CHUB” into “UTC”.2 The data frame was subsequently reduced to just these two species.2 And leaving all other species “names” as-is.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(species=case_when(\n    species %in% c(\"YCT\",\"Yct\") ~ \"YCT\",\n    species %in% c(\"UTC\",\"CHB\",\"CHUB\") ~ \"UTC\",\n    TRUE ~ species\n    )\n  ) |>\n  filter(species %in% c(\"YCT\",\"UTC\"))\n\n# just checking\nunique(dat$species)\n\n#R|  [1] \"YCT\" \"UTC\"\n\n\n\n\nAdding Gabelhouse Length Categories\nFigure 2 separates the data into panels based on Gabelhouse length categories (i.e., “Stock”, “Quality”, etc.). These categories can be efficiently added to the data frame using psdAdd() from FSA, but psdAdd() requires full species names rather than abbreviations. mapvalues() from plyr is used below to create a new variable with the full names derived from the abbreviations.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(species2=plyr::mapvalues(species,\n                                  from=c(\"YCT\",\"UTC\"),\n                                  to=c(\"Cutthroat Trout\",\"Utah Chub\")))\n# just checking\nxtabs(~species+species2,data=dat)\n\n#R|         species2\n#R|  species Cutthroat Trout Utah Chub\n#R|      UTC               0     14448\n#R|      YCT            5454         0\n\n\nNow the length categories may be added using species2.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(gcat=FSA::psdAdd(len=length,species=species2))\nFSA::headtail(dat)\n\n#R|        species year length weight        species2     gcat\n#R|  1         YCT 2002    150     NA Cutthroat Trout substock\n#R|  2         YCT 2002    160     NA Cutthroat Trout substock\n#R|  3         YCT 2002    160     NA Cutthroat Trout substock\n#R|  19900     YCT 2020    391    550 Cutthroat Trout  quality\n#R|  19901     YCT 2020    284    229 Cutthroat Trout    stock\n#R|  19902     YCT 2020    440    853 Cutthroat Trout  quality\n\n\n\n\nComputing CPE\nFrom this, the data needs to be summarized to produce the CPE for each species for each year for each length category and for all fish regardless of length category. Development of this data frame will begin by counting the number of fish (i.e., rows) for each length category within each year within each species.\n\ncatch_gcat <- dat |>\n  group_by(species,year,gcat) |>\n  summarize(catch=n())\ncatch_gcat\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 162 × 4\n#R|  # Groups:   species, year [36]\n#R|     species  year gcat      catch\n#R|     <chr>   <dbl> <fct>     <int>\n#R|   1 UTC      2003 substock      5\n#R|   2 UTC      2003 stock        41\n#R|   3 UTC      2003 quality      21\n#R|   4 UTC      2003 preferred    15\n#R|   5 UTC      2003 memorable     4\n#R|   6 UTC      2004 substock      2\n#R|   7 UTC      2004 stock       535\n#R|   8 UTC      2004 quality     128\n#R|   9 UTC      2004 preferred    52\n#R|  10 UTC      2004 memorable    11\n#R|  # … with 152 more rows\n\n\nNote in the previous output that catch_gcat is still “grouped” by year within species. Thus, catch can summed from this data frame to find the total catch per year for each species.33 Ungroup this data frame as we will not summarize it further.\n\ncatch_all <- catch_gcat |>\n  summarize(catch=sum(catch)) |>\n  ungroup()\ncatch_all\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 36 × 3\n#R|     species  year catch\n#R|     <chr>   <dbl> <int>\n#R|   1 UTC      2003    86\n#R|   2 UTC      2004   728\n#R|   3 UTC      2005   294\n#R|   4 UTC      2006   424\n#R|   5 UTC      2007   895\n#R|   6 UTC      2008   606\n#R|   7 UTC      2009   512\n#R|   8 UTC      2011   440\n#R|   9 UTC      2012   692\n#R|  10 UTC      2013  1858\n#R|  # … with 26 more rows\n\n\nAs Figure 2 displays all fish and fish by length category, these two data frames should be row-bound (i.e., stacked) together. Figure 2 does not have panels for “substock”, “memorable”, or “trophy” sized fish so fish in those length categories were removed from the resultant data frame. Finally, a new variable called type was created that has the names from gcat, or “All” if gcat was NA4.4 gcat for “all fish” after bind_rows() was NA as gcat was not present in catch_all\n\ncpe_dat <- bind_rows(catch_all,catch_gcat) |>\n  filter(!(gcat %in% c(\"substock\",\"memorable\",\"trophy\"))) |>\n  mutate(type=ifelse(is.na(gcat),\"All\",as.character(gcat)))\nFSA::headtail(cpe_dat)\n\n#R|      species year catch      gcat      type\n#R|  1       UTC 2003    86      <NA>       All\n#R|  2       UTC 2004   728      <NA>       All\n#R|  3       UTC 2005   294      <NA>       All\n#R|  143     YCT 2020    52     stock     stock\n#R|  144     YCT 2020   132   quality   quality\n#R|  145     YCT 2020    13 preferred preferred\n\n\nFinally, these data are left-join()ed (by year) with eff to add netNights, from which a new cpe variable is created. type was converted to a factor to match the vertical order of Figure 2, and the levels were given longer labels to match the labels in Figure 2. Finally, the variables were re-ordered (and gcat was dropped) for personal preference.\n\ncpe_dat <- cpe_dat |>\n  left_join(eff,by=\"year\") |>\n  mutate(cpe=catch/netNights,\n         type=factor(type,levels=c(\"All\",\"stock\",\"quality\",\"preferred\"),\n                     labels=c(\"All fish\",\"Stock to Quality\",\n                              \"Quality to Preferred\",\"Preferred to Memorable\"))) |>\n  select(species,year,type,catch,netNights,cpe)\nFSA::headtail(cpe_dat)\n\n#R|      species year                   type catch netNights        cpe\n#R|  1       UTC 2003               All fish    86        18  4.7777778\n#R|  2       UTC 2004               All fish   728        50 14.5600000\n#R|  3       UTC 2005               All fish   294        46  6.3913043\n#R|  143     YCT 2020       Stock to Quality    52        30  1.7333333\n#R|  144     YCT 2020   Quality to Preferred   132        30  4.4000000\n#R|  145     YCT 2020 Preferred to Memorable    13        30  0.4333333\n\n\nThis data frame, now called cpe_dat, is now ready for recreating Figure 2.\n\n\nQuick Summaries of CPE\nBefore recreating Figure 2, I summarized the CPE data by species and year for comparison to results in McCarrick et al. (2022).\n\ncpe_dat |>\n  filter(type==\"All fish\") |>\n  group_by(species) |>\n  summarize(n=n(),\n            ttlcatch=sum(catch),\n            mncpe=mean(cpe),\n            sdcpe=sd(cpe),\n            mincpe=min(cpe),\n            minyr=year[cpe==mincpe],\n            maxcpe=max(cpe),\n            maxyr=year[cpe==maxcpe])\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 2 × 9\n#R|    species     n ttlcatch mncpe sdcpe mincpe minyr maxcpe maxyr\n#R|    <chr>   <int>    <int> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>\n#R|  1 UTC        18    14459 20.0  12.9   0.239  2005   50.5  2008\n#R|  2 YCT        19     5454  7.16  3.48  1.52   2018   15.0  2007\n\n\nIn the first paragraph of the results, McCarrick et al. (2022) found the overall mean (and SD) CPE was 7.4 (3.6) for YCT and 19.9 (13.0) for UTC, which is close to what I obtained for UTC but not for YTC. In addition, they found a peak CPE of 15.4 for YCT in 2007 and 50.5 for UTC in 2008, again very close to my results for UTC but not that close for YCT. Finally, in the label for Figure 2 they reported 5,524 YCT were captured, whereas my results only show 5,454.\n \n\n\n\nRecreating Figure 2\nMy general strategy for recreating Figure 2 was to create the left and right panels of subplots separately and then combine them using patchwork. Each side can be constructed via faceting on type, but I will use facet_rep_wrap() from lemon so as to have the x-axis tick marks on each panel.5 Each panel will be create with geom_col() using width=1 so that the bars touch and geom_text() to place the labels.6 The x- and y-axes were modified as is commonly done.7 Finally, I used theme_bw() as a base, removed the gridlines and removed the facet labels and background.8 As you examine the code below, make sure to realize that the data was filtered to just “YCT”.5 See this post about facet_rep_wrap().6 See this post for more explanation of how to use geom_text() in this way.7 And is described more in this post.8 As described in this post.\n\nYCT <- ggplot(data=filter(cpe_dat,species==\"YCT\"),\n              mapping=aes(x=year,y=cpe)) +\n  geom_col(color=\"black\",fill=\"gray70\",width=1) +\n  geom_text(mapping=aes(label=type),x=Inf,y=Inf,vjust=1.25,hjust=1.05,\n            check_overlap=TRUE,size=3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"YCT per net night\",\n                     limits=c(0,16),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Year\",\n                     limits=c(2000,2022),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  lemon::facet_rep_wrap(vars(type),ncol=1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        strip.background=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_blank())\nYCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code above was largely repeated but with data filtered to just “UTC” and adjusting the y-axis accordingly. The plot is not shown here but is the right side in the plot further below.\n\nUTC <- ggplot(data=filter(cpe_dat,species==\"UTC\"),mapping=aes(x=year,y=cpe)) +\n  geom_col(color=\"black\",fill=\"gray70\",width=1) +\n  geom_text(mapping=aes(label=type),x=Inf,y=Inf,vjust=1.25,hjust=1.05,\n            check_overlap=TRUE,size=3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"UTC per net night\",\n                     limits=c(0,60),breaks=scales::breaks_width(10),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Year\",\n                     limits=c(2000,2022),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  lemon::facet_rep_wrap(vars(type),ncol=1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        strip.background=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_blank())\n\nThe two subplots are then placed side-by-side.\n\nYCT + UTC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFurther Thoughts\nI wanted to see if I could make a similar looking plot using facet_grid(). It turns out to be a bit of a challenge because each panel on the left- and right-sides has the same y-axis, but those axes differ between the two sides. I found a way around this.\nFirst, I changed species to a factor with “YCT” in the first position so it would be plotted on the left (i.e., first). I also gave the levels longer labels so that the facets would have useful labels.\n\ncpe_dat <- cpe_dat |>\n  mutate(species=factor(species,levels=c(\"YCT\",\"UTC\"),\n                        labels=c(\"Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout\",\"Utah Chub\")))\n\nThe y-axis needs to be defined for each facet. However, these definitions should be constant within species. Thus, I define limits and breaks for both YCT and UTC and saved them as objects. In addition, to save typing, I also defined the expansion factor as an object.\n\nYCT_lmts <- c(0,16)\nYCT_brks <- scales::breaks_width(2)\nUTC_lmts <- c(0,60)\nUTC_brks <- scales::breaks_width(10)\nyexp <- expansion(mult=0)\n\nThe basic plot uses the same ggplot() (except the data is not filtered), geom_col(), scale_x_continous(), and theme_bw() as before. The geom_text() has been eliminated because the “type” labels are going to be in the facet labels rather than “on the plot.” The part of theme() that removed the facet labels has been eliminated as facet labels are needed here. The spacing between panels was increased in theme() here. facet_rep_wrap() was replaced with facet_grid2() from ggh4x, where the rows are defined by type, the columns are defined by species, the y-axes are “free” and “independent” from facet to facet.9 Finally, facetted_pos_scales() from ggh4x is used to apply a different scale_y_continous() to each panel.109 The independent=\"y\" part is the main thing that facet_grid2() adds over facet_grid() from ggplot2.10 facetted_pos_scales() is described in more detail in this post.\n\nggplot(data=cpe_dat,mapping=aes(x=year,y=cpe)) +\n  geom_col(color=\"black\",fill=\"gray70\",width=1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Year\",\n                     limits=c(2000,2022),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  ggh4x::facet_grid2(rows=vars(type),cols=vars(species),\n                     scales=\"free_y\",independent=\"y\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        panel.spacing=unit(10,units=\"pt\")) +\n  ggh4x::facetted_pos_scales(\n    y=list(\n      scale_y_continuous(name=\"# Fish per net night\",\n                         limits=YCT_lmts,breaks=YCT_brks,expand=yexp),\n      scale_y_continuous(limits=UTC_lmts,breaks=UTC_brks,expand=yexp),\n      scale_y_continuous(limits=YCT_lmts,breaks=YCT_brks,expand=yexp),\n      scale_y_continuous(limits=UTC_lmts,breaks=UTC_brks,expand=yexp),\n      scale_y_continuous(limits=YCT_lmts,breaks=YCT_brks,expand=yexp),\n      scale_y_continuous(limits=UTC_lmts,breaks=UTC_brks,expand=yexp),\n      scale_y_continuous(limits=YCT_lmts,breaks=YCT_brks,expand=yexp),\n      scale_y_continuous(limits=UTC_lmts,breaks=UTC_brks,expand=yexp)\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMcCarrick, D.

(2022) examined the population dynamics of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri) in Henrys Lake, Idaho over a nearly two decade period. Their Figure 3 showed various proportional stock distribution (PSD) calculations of Cutthroat Trout across years. I use ggplot2 to recreate that figure here. I also modified their plot by adding confidence intervals to the calculations.\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. A few functions from each of lubridate, FSA, plyr, tidyr, scales, gghrx, and lemon are used with :: such that the entire packages are not attached here.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # for dplyr, ggplot2 packages\n\nMcCarrick et al. (2022) computed what I am calling an overall PSD1 and what are called “incremental” PSD indices. I assume that these are familar to most fisheries scientists, but they are described in more detail in Chapter 6 of Ogle (2016).21 This is the most common PSD measure.2 This provides a decent description of the overall PSD.\n \n\n\nData Wrangling\n\nIndividual Fish Data Frame\nMcCarrick et al. (2022) provided raw data for Figure 2 as an Excel file in their Data Supplement S1.

Each PSD calculation requires the total number of stock-size and larger fish as the denominator; i.e., 49 fish in 2002. In addition, the overall PSD calculation requires the total number of quality-sized and larger fish as the numerator; i.e., 28 fish in 2002. These two quantities are computed in mutate() below, but note that rowwise() is used before that to force the calculations to be computed by row (i.e., by year).33 If rowwise is not used then, for example, sum(stock+quality) would be the sum of both the stock and quality columns; i.e., the sum across all years.\n\npsd_dat <- psd_dat |>\n  rowwise() |>\n  mutate(qualityplus=sum(quality,preferred,memorable,trophy,na.rm=TRUE),\n         stockplus=sum(stock,qualityplus,na.rm=TRUE))\nFSA::headtail(psd_dat)\n\n#R|     year stock quality preferred memorable trophy qualityplus stockplus\n#R|  1  2002    20      28         1        NA     NA          29        49\n#R|  2  2003    31      57        43        NA     NA         100       131\n#R|  3  2004   141      36        27         1     NA          64       205\n#R|  17 2018    34      16        22         1     NA          39        73\n#R|  18 2019   176      20        17         3     NA          40       216\n#R|  19 2020    52     132        13        NA     NA         145       197\n\n\nThe overall PSD is calculated as quality-sized and larger fish divided by stock-sized and larger fish multiplied by 100. The three incremental PSD values are calculated as the number in the incremental length group (e.g., stock- to quality-sized) divided by stock-sized and larger fish multiplied by 100. These calculations are made below within mutate().44 The incremental PSD names are within single back-ticks because the name contains a space (and a hyphen).\n\npsd_dat <- psd_dat |>\n  mutate(PSD=qualityplus/stockplus*100,\n         `PSD S-Q`=stock/stockplus*100,\n         `PSD Q-P`=quality/stockplus*100,\n         `PSD P-M`=preferred/stockplus*100) |>\n  ungroup()\nFSA::headtail(psd_dat)\n\n#R|     year stock quality preferred memorable trophy qualityplus stockplus      PSD\n#R|  1  2002    20      28         1        NA     NA          29        49 59.18367\n#R|  2  2003    31      57        43        NA     NA         100       131 76.33588\n#R|  3  2004   141      36        27         1     NA          64       205 31.21951\n#R|  17 2018    34      16        22         1     NA          39        73 53.42466\n#R|  18 2019   176      20        17         3     NA          40       216 18.51852\n#R|  19 2020    52     132        13        NA     NA         145       197 73.60406\n#R|      PSD S-Q   PSD Q-P   PSD P-M\n#R|  1  40.81633 57.142857  2.040816\n#R|  2  23.66412 43.511450 32.824427\n#R|  3  68.78049 17.560976 13.170732\n#R|  17 46.57534 21.917808 30.136986\n#R|  18 81.48148  9.259259  7.870370\n#R|  19 26.39594 67.005076  6.598985\n\n\nFinally, this data frame should be made longer such that the calculated PSD values will appear under one column (called values) and another column will be created with the name of the PSD metric. This process begins by restricting the data frame to the year and all calculated PSD values, then pivoting the values in all of the PSD columns into one column with the names of the PSD metric stored in metric, and then factoring metric with the levels controlled so that they will be plotted in the same order as in Figure 3. This new data frame has a new name, as the original psd_dat data frame is used further below.\n\npsd_dat2 <- psd_dat |>\n  select(year,contains(\"PSD\")) |>\n  pivot_longer(cols=contains(\"PSD\"),names_to=\"metric\") |>\n  mutate(metric=factor(metric,levels=c(\"PSD\",\"PSD S-Q\",\"PSD Q-P\",\"PSD P-M\")))\nFSA::headtail(psd_dat2)\n\n#R|     year  metric     value\n#R|  1  2002     PSD 59.183673\n#R|  2  2002 PSD S-Q 40.816327\n#R|  3  2002 PSD Q-P 57.142857\n#R|  74 2020 PSD S-Q 26.395939\n#R|  75 2020 PSD Q-P 67.005076\n#R|  76 2020 PSD P-M  6.598985\n\n\nThis data frame, now called psd_dat2, is ready for recreating Figure 3.\n \n\n\n\nRecreating Figure 3\nFigure 3 is a simple bar plot facetted across years similar to the CPE plot in this previous post. Thus, I don’t discuss the details further here.\n\nggplot(data=psd_dat2,mapping=aes(x=year,y=value)) +\n  geom_col(color=\"black\",fill=\"gray70\",width=1) +\n  geom_text(mapping=aes(label=metric),x=Inf,y=Inf,vjust=1.25,hjust=1.05,size=3,\n            check_overlap=TRUE) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"PSD\",limits=c(0,100),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(20)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Year\",\n                     limits=c(2000,2022),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  lemon::facet_rep_wrap(vars(metric),ncol=1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        strip.background=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdding Confidence Intervals\nI wanted to see if I could make Figure 3 as above, but add confidence intervals to the PSD calculations.55 The authors added CIs to the relative weight calculations in their Figure 4, but did not do that here for their PSD calculations.\nAs discussed in Ogle (2016) confidence intervals for a PSD can be made from binomial distribution theory using binCI() from FSA. This is a simple process of giving binCI() the number of “successes” (i.e., the numerator in the PSD calculation), the number of “trials”(i.e., the denominator), and the type of algorithm to use (we will use the “Wilson” algorithm here). For example, the CI for the overall PSD in 2002 is computed below.\n\nFSA::binCI(29,49,type=\"wilson\")*100\n\n#R|    95% LCI  95% UCI\n#R|   45.24732 71.78476\n\n\nThis becomes complicated here for several reasons:\n\nThe CIs are computed across multiple years.\nThe numerators differ among the PSD metrics (e.g., quality-sized and larger fish for the overall PSD but just quality-sized fish for PSD S-Q).\nbinCI() returns two values rather than 1 (thus, complicating the use of mutate()).\nbinCI() returns a matrix with column names rather than a named vector.\n\nGiven these issues, confidence intervals the PSD, PSD S-Q, etc. will each be calculated separately and then combined into a single data frame. I begin by calculating the CIs for the PSD.\nHere we return to the wide psd_dat data frame from above. The calculation will be for each year so again use rowwise(). FSA::binCI() will be used with mutate() but its result must first be converted to a vector with as.vector() (addresses last issue above) and then put in a list(). In this case the ci “variable” will be a list with two items (the lower and upper CI values) for each year. We want to get the two values out of this list and into their own variables, which is accomplished with unnest_wider() from tidyr (addressing the third issue above). The results from binCI() (after as.vector()) were unnamed, so names_sep= must be used in unnest_wider(). With this set to \"\", the unnested variables will be the original name (“ci”) followed by sequential numbers (i.e., “ci1” and “ci2” here). Finally,the data frame is reduced to the year, PSD, ci1, and ci2 variables, but PSD is renamed value along the way.66 This renaming is necessary for bind_rows() further below.\n\ntmp1 <- psd_dat |>\n  rowwise() |>\n  mutate(ci=list(as.vector(FSA::binCI(qualityplus,stockplus,type=\"wilson\")))) |>\n  tidyr::unnest_wider(ci,names_sep=\"\") |>\n  select(year,value=PSD,ci1,ci2)\nFSA::headtail(tmp1)\n\n#R|     year    value       ci1       ci2\n#R|  1  2002 59.18367 0.4524732 0.7178476\n#R|  2  2003 76.33588 0.6837273 0.8279848\n#R|  3  2004 31.21951 0.2527076 0.3785916\n#R|  17 2018 53.42466 0.4209895 0.6440796\n#R|  18 2019 18.51852 0.1390441 0.2423283\n#R|  19 2020 73.60406 0.6703995 0.7926523\n\n\nThis exact code is repeated for PSD S-Q but making sure that stock is the first argument to binCI(), the new value variable comes from PSD S-Q, and the resulting data frame is given a different name.\n\ntmp2 <- psd_dat |>\n  rowwise() |>\n  mutate(ci=list(as.vector(FSA::binCI(stock,stockplus,type=\"wilson\")))) |>\n  tidyr::unnest_wider(ci,names_sep=\"\") |>\n  select(year,value=`PSD S-Q`,ci1,ci2)\n\nThis process is repeated for the other two metrics.\n\ntmp3 <- psd_dat |>\n  rowwise() |>\n  mutate(ci=list(as.vector(FSA::binCI(quality,stockplus,type=\"wilson\")))) |>\n  tidyr::unnest_wider(ci,names_sep=\"\") |>\n  select(year,value=`PSD Q-P`,ci1,ci2)\n\n\ntmp4 <- psd_dat |>\n  rowwise() |>\n  mutate(ci=list(as.vector(FSA::binCI(preferred,stockplus,type=\"wilson\")))) |>\n  tidyr::unnest_wider(ci,names_sep=\"\") |>\n  select(year,value=`PSD P-M`,ci1,ci2)\n\nThese four temporary data frames are bound together with a metric variable added to indicate which PSD metric appears in each row of the new data frame. Additionally, ci1 and ci2 were renamed to LCI and UCI for clarity, each CI endpoint was muliplied by 100 to put it on the same scale as the point estimates (i.e., percentages rather than proportions returned from binCI()), and metric was factored with controlled levels as above.\n\npsd_dat3 <- bind_rows(list(\"PSD\"=tmp1,\"PSD S-Q\"=tmp2,\"PSD Q-P\"=tmp3,\"PSD P-M\"=tmp4),\n                      .id=\"metric\") |>\n  rename(LCI=`ci1`,UCI=`ci2`) |>\n  mutate(LCI=LCI*100,UCI=UCI*100,\n         metric=factor(metric,levels=c(\"PSD\",\"PSD S-Q\",\"PSD Q-P\",\"PSD P-M\")))\nFSA::headtail(psd_dat3)\n\n#R|      metric year     value       LCI      UCI\n#R|  1      PSD 2002 59.183673 45.247319 71.78476\n#R|  2      PSD 2003 76.335878 68.372730 82.79848\n#R|  3      PSD 2004 31.219512 25.270764 37.85916\n#R|  74 PSD P-M 2018 30.136986 20.822591 41.43737\n#R|  75 PSD P-M 2019  7.870370  4.971693 12.24137\n#R|  76 PSD P-M 2020  6.598985  3.896693 10.96152\n\n\nThe same code used above to recreate Figure 3 is repeated below, but geom_errorbar() is used with LCI mapped to ymin= and UCI mapped to ymax= to form the confidence intervals. geom_errorbar() is before geom_col() which gives the appearance of only showing the upper portion of the confidence interval (i.e., the lower portion is behind the bar). width=0.25 was used to narrow the “caps” on the intervals.\n\nggplot(data=psd_dat3,mapping=aes(x=year,y=value)) +\n  geom_errorbar(mapping=aes(ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI),width=0.25) +\n  geom_col(color=\"black\",fill=\"gray70\",width=1) +\n  geom_text(mapping=aes(label=metric),x=Inf,y=Inf,vjust=1.25,hjust=1.05,size=3,\n            check_overlap=TRUE) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"PSD\",limits=c(0,100),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(20)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Year\",\n                     limits=c(2000,2022),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  lemon::facet_rep_wrap(vars(metric),ncol=1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        strip.background=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFurther Thoughts\n\nPoint-and-Lines Plot\nAs mentioned in this previous post I understand that these are the much derided “dynamite plots”.

(2022) examined the population dynamics of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri) in Henrys Lake, Idaho over a nearly two decade period. Their Figure 4 showed mean (with confidence interval) relative weight (Wr) for various length categories of Cutthroat Trout across years. I use ggplot2 to recreate that figure here.\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. A few functions from each of lubridate, FSA, plyr, scales, gghrx, lemon, and ggtext are used with :: such that the entire packages are not attached here.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # for dplyr, ggplot2 packages\n\nMcCarrick et al. (2022) computed what I am calling an overall PSD1 and what are called “incremental” PSD indices. I assume that these are familar to most fisheries scientists, but they are described in more detail in Chapter 8 of Ogle (2016).21 This is the most common PSD measure.2 Also see Blackwell et al. (2000).\n \n\n\nData Wrangling\n\nIndividual Fish Data Frame\nMcCarrick et al. (2022) provided raw data for Figure 2 as an Excel file in their Data Supplement S1. The same data wrangling, up to where catch-per-unit-effort was calculated, used in this previous post is used here3 and, thus, will not be discussed in detail.3 And in this post\n\ndat <- readxl::read_xlsx(\"../2023-3-22_McCarricketal2022_Fig2/download.xlsx\",\n                         na=c(\"\",\"??\",\"QTY =\",\"QTY=\",\"UNK\",\"NO TAG\"),\n                         col_types=c(\"date\",\"numeric\",\"text\",\n                                     \"numeric\",\"numeric\",\"text\")) |>\n  mutate(year=lubridate::year(Date),\n         year=ifelse(year==1905,2002,year)) |>\n  filter(!is.na(year)) |>\n  select(species=Species,year,length,weight)  |>\n  mutate(species=case_when(\n    species %in% c(\"YCT\",\"Yct\") ~ \"YCT\",\n    species %in% c(\"UTC\",\"CHB\",\"CHUB\") ~ \"UTC\",\n    TRUE ~ species\n  )) |>\n  filter(species %in% c(\"YCT\",\"UTC\")) |>\n  mutate(species2=plyr::mapvalues(species,\n                                  from=c(\"YCT\",\"UTC\"),\n                                  to=c(\"Cutthroat Trout\",\"Utah Chub\"))) |>\n  mutate(gcat=FSA::psdAdd(len=length,species=species2))\n\nFSA::headtail(dat)\n\n#R|        species year length weight        species2     gcat\n#R|  1         YCT 2002    150     NA Cutthroat Trout substock\n#R|  2         YCT 2002    160     NA Cutthroat Trout substock\n#R|  3         YCT 2002    160     NA Cutthroat Trout substock\n#R|  19900     YCT 2020    391    550 Cutthroat Trout  quality\n#R|  19901     YCT 2020    284    229 Cutthroat Trout    stock\n#R|  19902     YCT 2020    440    853 Cutthroat Trout  quality\n\n\nThe relative weigt for each fish needs to be added to this data frame, preferably with wrAdd() from FSA. Note, however, that there are two standard weight equations for Cutthroat Trout, one for lentic and one for lotic populations. We want to make sure to use the one for lentic populations here and, thus, cannot use the species name found in the data frame within wrAdd(). Note below that the data frame was also reduced to just Cutthroat Trout for which a weight was recorded, and the two species variables were dropped (just to simplify the output).\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  filter(species==\"YCT\",!is.na(weight)) |>\n  mutate(wr=FSA::wrAdd(weight,length,spec=\"Cutthroat Trout (lentic)\")) |>\n  select(-starts_with(\"species\"))\nFSA::headtail(dat)\n\n#R|       year length weight     gcat        wr\n#R|  1    2004    174     54 substock 102.34315\n#R|  2    2004    227    130    stock 108.45450\n#R|  3    2004    305    380    stock 127.41903\n#R|  5208 2020    391    550  quality  85.68508\n#R|  5209 2020    284    229    stock  95.69629\n#R|  5210 2020    440    853  quality  92.31113\n\n\n\n\nWr Summary Data Frame\nSummary statistics of relative weight for all fish is computed below.\n\nwr_all <- dat |>\n  group_by(year) |>\n  summarize(n=n(),\n            mn_wr=mean(wr,na.rm=TRUE),\n            sd_wr=sd(wr,na.rm=TRUE),\n            se_wr=FSA::se(wr,na.rm=TRUE))\nFSA::headtail(wr_all)\n\n#R|     year   n     mn_wr     sd_wr     se_wr\n#R|  1  2004 300 116.50388 16.405045 0.9650026\n#R|  2  2005 305 103.70058 14.860984 0.8509375\n#R|  3  2006 269 107.66011 20.258635 1.2351908\n#R|  15 2018  76 107.05779 25.899713 2.9709008\n#R|  16 2019 219  97.20635  7.485436 0.5058189\n#R|  17 2020 198  94.78333  8.648857 0.6146475\n\n\nSummary statistics of relative weight for each length category is computed below.\n\nwr_gcat <- dat |>\n  group_by(year,gcat) |>\n  summarize(n=n(),\n            mn_wr=mean(wr,na.rm=TRUE),\n            sd_wr=sd(wr,na.rm=TRUE),\n            se_wr=FSA::se(wr,na.rm=TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup()\nFSA::headtail(wr_gcat)\n\n#R|     year      gcat   n     mn_wr     sd_wr     se_wr\n#R|  1  2004  substock 110 103.54857 13.477955 1.3545854\n#R|  2  2004     stock 130 123.09751 11.535665 1.0117447\n#R|  3  2004   quality  34 127.50055 12.158543 2.0851728\n#R|  68 2020     stock  52  95.40331 10.326851 1.4320766\n#R|  69 2020   quality 132  94.78427  8.119609 0.7067213\n#R|  70 2020 preferred  13  92.28008  6.826683 1.8933812\n\n\nMcCarrick et al.

Because the data frame for all fish did not have a gcat variable, that variable will be populated with NA when the two data frames are bound. The ifelse() below converts these NA values to All, before gcat is factored with levels ordered as they would appear in Figure 4 and with more descriptive labels. Finally, for aesthetic purposes, I moved gcat to be the first variable and sorted the results by year within length category.\n\nwr_dat <- bind_rows(wr_all,wr_gcat) |>\n  mutate(gcat=ifelse(is.na(gcat),\"All\",as.character(gcat)),\n         gcat=factor(gcat,levels=c(\"All\",\"stock\",\"quality\",\"preferred\"),\n                     labels=c(\"All fish\",\"Stock to Quality\",\n                              \"Quality to Preferred\",\"Preferred to Memorable\"))) |>\n  relocate(gcat) |>\n  arrange(gcat,year)\nFSA::headtail(wr_dat)\n\n#R|                       gcat year   n     mn_wr     sd_wr     se_wr\n#R|  1                All fish 2004 300 116.50388 16.405045 0.9650026\n#R|  2                All fish 2005 305 103.70058 14.860984 0.8509375\n#R|  3                All fish 2006 269 107.66011 20.258635 1.2351908\n#R|  66 Preferred to Memorable 2018  22  98.79180 17.476556 3.7260144\n#R|  67 Preferred to Memorable 2019  17  98.61326  8.666677 2.1019780\n#R|  68 Preferred to Memorable 2020  13  92.28008  6.826683 1.8933812\n\n\nFinally, the lower and upper confidence intervals for each mean are added to the data frame using normal distribution theory.44 qt() returns a the 97.5th percent critical value from a t-distribution with df degrees-of-freedom.\n\nwr_dat <- wr_dat |>\n  mutate(lci=mn_wr-qt(0.975,df=n-1)*se_wr,\n         uci=mn_wr+qt(0.975,df=n-1)*se_wr)\nFSA::headtail(wr_dat)\n\n#R|                       gcat year   n     mn_wr     sd_wr     se_wr       lci\n#R|  1                All fish 2004 300 116.50388 16.405045 0.9650026 114.60482\n#R|  2                All fish 2005 305 103.70058 14.860984 0.8509375 102.02610\n#R|  3                All fish 2006 269 107.66011 20.258635 1.2351908 105.22820\n#R|  66 Preferred to Memorable 2018  22  98.79180 17.476556 3.7260144  91.04313\n#R|  67 Preferred to Memorable 2019  17  98.61326  8.666677 2.1019780  94.15727\n#R|  68 Preferred to Memorable 2020  13  92.28008  6.826683 1.8933812  88.15476\n#R|          uci\n#R|  1  118.4029\n#R|  2  105.3750\n#R|  3  110.0920\n#R|  66 106.5405\n#R|  67 103.0693\n#R|  68  96.4054\n\n\nThis data frame, now called wr_dat, is ready for recreating Figure 4.\n \n\n\n\nRecreating Figure 4\nFigure 4 is a simple bar plot facetted across years similar to the PSD plot in this previous post. Confidence intervals are added as described in that same post. Thus, many of the details below are not discussed further here. However, there are two new things to consider here.\nFirst, the y-axis in Figure 4 in (mccarricketal_2020?) is limited from 70 to 140. If limits=c(70,140) is used in scale_y_continuous() as described in this post the bars will be removed because their “data” extends to zero.5 Thus, the limits of the y-axis must be set with ylim= in coord_cartesian() to preserved the bars.5 Data points outside axis limits created in this way are treated as missing and are removed from the figure.\nSecond, the y-axis label in Figure 4 in (mccaricketal_2020?) is italicized with a subscript “r”. In the markdown language, asterisks are used to denoted italics and the tilde is used to create a subscript, which can be seen in name= in scale_y_continuous(). However, to make this markdown code render properly axis.title.y= in theme must be set to element_markdown() from ggtext.\n\nggplot(data=wr_dat,mapping=aes(x=year,y=mn_wr)) +\n  geom_errorbar(mapping=aes(ymin=lci,ymax=uci),width=0.25) +\n  geom_col(color=\"black\",fill=\"gray70\",width=1) +\n  geom_text(mapping=aes(label=gcat),x=Inf,y=Inf,vjust=1.25,hjust=1.05,size=3,\n            check_overlap=TRUE) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"*W~r~*\",expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(10)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Year\",\n                     limits=c(2000,2022),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(70,140)) +\n  lemon::facet_rep_wrap(vars(gcat),ncol=1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        strip.background=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y=ggtext::element_markdown())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFurther Thoughts\n\nPoint-and-Lines Plot\nAs mentioned in this previous post I understand that these are the much derided “dynamite plots”. Personally, I find the bars distracting (so much gray with little purpose and starting at 70) and find a point-and-lines plot, possibly with a horizontal line at the common reference value of 100.\n\nggplot(data=wr_dat,mapping=aes(x=year,y=mn_wr)) +\n  geom_errorbar(mapping=aes(ymin=lci,ymax=uci),width=0.25) +\n  geom_line(linewidth=0.75,color=\"gray70\") +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=100,color=\"gray30\",linetype=\"dashed\",linewidth=0.5) +\n  geom_text(mapping=aes(label=gcat),x=Inf,y=Inf,vjust=1.25,hjust=1.05,size=3,\n            check_overlap=TRUE) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"*W~r~*\",limits=c(70,140),expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(10)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Year\",\n                     limits=c(2000,2022),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  lemon::facet_rep_wrap(vars(gcat),ncol=1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        strip.background=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y=ggtext::element_markdown())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBlackwell, B., M.

Note that the columns to pivot in cols= were selected by ignoring year and, thus, leaving all of the Age X columns.11 The columns also could have been selected with starts_with(\"Age\"), among other possibilities.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  pivot_longer(cols=-Year,names_to=\"Age\",values_to=\"Proportion\")\nFSA::headtail(dat)\n\n#R|      Year    Age Proportion\n#R|  1   2002  Age 1      0.113\n#R|  2   2002  Age 2      0.460\n#R|  3   2002  Age 3      0.394\n#R|  207 2020  Age 9      0.000\n#R|  208 2020 Age 10      0.001\n#R|  209 2020 Age 11      0.000\n\n\nThe Age variable should be converted to a factor so that the levels can be controlled, otherwise “Age 10” will follow “Age 1”.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(Age=factor(Age,levels=c(\"Age 1\",\"Age 2\",\"Age 3\",\"Age 4\",\"Age 5\",\"Age 6\",\n                                 \"Age 7\",\"Age 8\",\"Age 9\",\"Age 10\",\"Age 11\")))\n\nThis data frame is ready for recreating Figure 5.\n \n\n\nRecreating Figure 5\nFigure 5 is an “area plot” which is easily constructed in ggplot2 with geom_area(), with the variable that defines the colored areas (i.e., Age) mapped to fill=.22 I plotted every other on the x-axis as the font needed to be so small to show every year at in McCarrick et al. (2022).\n\nggplot(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Proportion,fill=Age)) +\n  geom_area() +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=c(2002,2020),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI won’t address color here (but see further below) as these colors are no uglier than what is shown in the published Figure 5. However, there are other adjustments that need to be made to match Figure 5.\nFirst, the ages above are stacked opposite of what is in Figure 5; i.e., age-1 is at the top, age-2 below that, etc. rather than age-1 at the bottom, age-2 on top of that, etc. The order of stacking is reversed with position= in geom_area() as shown below. Second, the authors included two digits for the values on the y-axis for some reason. Assuming this behavior is desired it can be obtained with scales::label_number() in scale_y_continuous() as shown below.33 This was demonstrated in this post.\n\nggplot(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Proportion,fill=Age)) +\n  geom_area(position=position_stack(reverse=TRUE)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1),\n                     label=scales::label_number(0.01)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=c(2002,2020),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, the legend needs to be moved to below the x-axis. This is easily accomplished with legend.position=\"bottom\" in theme(). However, doing this alone shows the legend in three rows. One row was used for the legend as shown below with guides(). Finally, other theme options were altered to remove the legend title and make the legend symbols and text smaller.\n\nggplot(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Proportion,fill=Age)) +\n  geom_area(position=position_stack(reverse=TRUE)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1),\n                     label=scales::label_number(0.01)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=c(2002,2020),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(nrow=1)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        legend.position=\"bottom\",\n        legend.title=element_blank(),\n        legend.key.size=unit(2,\"mm\"),\n        legend.text=element_text(size=7))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis largely recreates Figure 5 in McCarrick et al. (2022).\n \n\n\nPossible Modifications\nArea plots are notorious for being difficult for readers to interpret.4 Below I offer some modifications that may(?) aid interpretation.4 See this for example.\n\nLump Ages\nMany potential ages are shown in Figure 5 though ages greater than age-5 are rarely visible (or noticeable) as they never represent more than 10% in total or 4% individually of the fish in any given year.\n\n# Find maximum proportion by age, is that more than 5%\ndat |> group_by(Age) |> summarize(maxP=max(Proportion))\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 11 × 2\n#R|     Age     maxP\n#R|     <fct>  <dbl>\n#R|   1 Age 1  0.39 \n#R|   2 Age 2  0.774\n#R|   3 Age 3  0.677\n#R|   4 Age 4  0.289\n#R|   5 Age 5  0.101\n#R|   6 Age 6  0.04 \n#R|   7 Age 7  0.031\n#R|   8 Age 8  0.013\n#R|   9 Age 9  0.019\n#R|  10 Age 10 0.002\n#R|  11 Age 11 0.001\n\n\nThe number of colors used in the plot, and the number of areas that the reader looks for, can be reduced by lumping together ages that are not well-represented in the data. Below fct_collapse() from forcats is used to collapse the “Age 6” to “Age 11” levels in Age to one level called “Age 6+”. To preserve the original data this data frame was called dat2.\n\ndat2 <- dat |>\n  mutate(Age=forcats::fct_collapse(Age,`Age 6+`=c(\"Age 6\",\"Age 7\",\"Age 7\",\"Age 8\",\n                                                  \"Age 9\",\"Age 10\",\"Age 11\")))\nFSA::headtail(dat2)\n\n#R|      Year    Age Proportion\n#R|  1   2002  Age 1      0.113\n#R|  2   2002  Age 2      0.460\n#R|  3   2002  Age 3      0.394\n#R|  207 2020 Age 6+      0.000\n#R|  208 2020 Age 6+      0.001\n#R|  209 2020 Age 6+      0.000\n\n\nHowever, “Age 6+” was simply repeated for the original “Age 6”, “Age 7”, etc. The proportions for these ages should be summed, within each year, to get a proper proportion of “Age 6+” fish.55 Summing the proportions for the ages that were lumped will just return the proportion for those ages.\n\ndat2 <- dat2 |>\n  group_by(Year,Age) |>\n  summarize(Proportion=sum(Proportion)) |>\n  ungroup()\nFSA::headtail(dat2)\n\n#R|      Year    Age Proportion\n#R|  1   2002  Age 1      0.113\n#R|  2   2002  Age 2      0.460\n#R|  3   2002  Age 3      0.394\n#R|  112 2020  Age 4      0.096\n#R|  113 2020  Age 5      0.003\n#R|  114 2020 Age 6+      0.013\n\n\nTo save some typing below, I set the theme to the theme items above with the exception that I moved the legend back to the right where I think it is more appropriate.\n\ntheme_set(\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        legend.title=element_blank(),\n        legend.key.size=unit(3,\"mm\"),\n        legend.text=element_text(size=8))\n)\n\nThe code for Figure 5 is largely repeated below with these data. However, I reversed the order of the labels in the legend with guides() so that the labels more naturally followed how the areas were plotted and I removed the unnecessary extra digit in the y-axis labels.\n\nggplot(data=dat2,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Proportion,fill=Age)) +\n  geom_area(position=position_stack(reverse=TRUE)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=c(2002,2020),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor\nChanging the color is not necessarily going to make the figure easier to interpret. However, a gradient of color can be used to more clearly represent the gradient of age. Here, I form a gradient of grays with scale_fill_grey().\n\nggplot(data=dat2,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Proportion,fill=Age)) +\n  geom_area(position=position_stack(reverse=TRUE)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=c(2002,2020),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n  scale_fill_grey(start=0.2,end=0.8) +\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sequential palette that ranges from dark green to light blue is used below with scale_fill_brewer(). A variety of palettes may be chosen in this function as described in its documentation. Note that direction=-1 was used here to reverse the palette order as I preferred the darker colors for age-1 and the lighter colors for age-6+.\n\nggplot(data=dat2,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Proportion,fill=Age)) +\n  geom_area(position=position_stack(reverse=TRUE)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=c(2002,2020),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"BuGn\",direction=-1) +\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther palette algorithms can also be used. Below, scale_fill_viridis_d() is used as an example.\n\nggplot(data=dat2,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Proportion,fill=Age)) +\n  geom_area(position=position_stack(reverse=TRUE)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=c(2002,2020),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(begin=0.25,end=0.9) +\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere is both an art and a science behind choosing colors for plots. Unfortunately, I am not strong nor fully knowledgeable in either. Thus, I show how to alter colors here, but I don’t claim that these choices are ideal.\n\n\n\n\nAdd Lines\nI sometimes feel that the colors in area plots “run together” in my eyes. One way to make more clear “breaks” is to highlight the color changes. Below I also map Age to color=, use scale_color_viridis_d() with the same options as scale_fill_viridis_d(), except that for the fill I set a slight transparency with alpha=. Here color= is used for the boundaries of the areas and since the fill was made transparent these boundaries are a bit darker and, thus, appear as lines between the areas. Further note that both fill= and color= had to be “reversed” in guides().\n\nggplot(data=dat2,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Proportion,fill=Age,color=Age)) +\n  geom_area(position=position_stack(reverse=TRUE),linewidth=0.75) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=c(2002,2020),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(begin=0.25,end=0.9) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(begin=0.25,end=0.9,alpha=0.75) +\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE),\n         color=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar Chart\nMost people that eschew the use of area plots suggests using bar charts instead. This is easily accomplished here by replacing geom_area() with geom_col(). However, the limits of the x-axis will need to be extended by one year on both sides so that the first and last year will be shown correctly.\n\nggplot(data=dat2,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Proportion,fill=Age)) +\n  geom_col(position=position_stack(reverse=TRUE)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=c(2001,2021),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(begin=0.25,end=0.9) +\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacets\nFinally, I think that if the goal is to show annular trends for the specific ages, that they should be plotted as lines for each age. Here lines are used with geom_line() and faceting was used on Age. The use of color is superfluous here, but I kept it for comparing with the previous options.\n\nggplot(data=dat2,mapping=aes(x=Year,y=Proportion,color=Age)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth=0.75) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025)),\n                     breaks=scales::breaks_width(0.1)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=c(2002,2020),breaks=scales::breaks_width(2)) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(begin=0.25,end=0.9) +\n  lemon::facet_rep_wrap(vars(Age),ncol=1,strip.position=\"right\") +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my view, it is much easier to decipher what is going on with age-2 to age-4 fish from this plot.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMcCarrick, D.

    "text": "Series Note\n\n\n\nThis is the fifth, and last, of several posts related to McCarrick et al. (2022). I thank the authors for making their data available with their publication.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nMcCarrick et al. (2022) examined the population dynamics of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri) in Henrys Lake, Idaho over a nearly two decade period. Their Figure 6 showed the back-calculated total length of both Cutthroat Trout at three ages separated by decade and their Figure 7 showed the mean (and SE) back-calculated TL at age for two time periods. I use ggplot2 here to recreate both figures.\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. A few functions from each of readxl, FSA, scales, and lemon are used with :: such that the entire packages are not attached here.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # for dplyr, ggplot2 packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will see below that I could recreate the structure but not the exact results of the author’s Figure 6 or Figure 7. This may be due to issues present in the data provided with the publication that I discuss below, but it could also be that my data wrangling differs from theirs. I defer to the authors here as they are the experts with their data; I am just an interloper. I actually appreciate these data issues from an educational perspective as they provide rich opportunities to demonstrate a variety of techniques with “real” “messy” data.\n\n\n \n\n\nData Wrangling\n\nReading Excel File and Handling Some Initial Issuees\nMcCarrick et al. (2022) provided raw data for these figures as an Excel file in their Data Supplement S2. An initial glance at the Excel file revealed that every other line in the file was essentially a header line for the annular measurements on the scales or otoliths.1 Fortunately, when these data were read in below, those lines appeared as missing data for the age-at-capture variable (as well as several others). Thus, I immediately removed rows with missing values in the age-at-capture variable. The variable names in Excel were also longer than I prefer so I renamed the variables that I chose to retain.1 This was not immediately obvious in the Excel file as a filter had been applied to hide those rows. I had to remove the filter in Excel to see the issue.\n\ndat <- readxl::read_excel(\"Download.xlsx\") |>\n  select(Year,ID=Fish_Number,Structure,capAge=Age_at_Capture,capTL=Total_Length_mm,\n         edge,starts_with(\"annulus\")) |>\n  filter(!is.na(capAge))\n\nFSA::headtail(dat)\n\n#R|       Year   ID Structure capAge capTL edge annulus1 annulus2 annulus3 annulus4\n#R|  1    2020  143   Otolith      3   402  982      464      754      982       NA\n#R|  2    2020  122   Otolith      2   266  692      428      692       NA       NA\n#R|  3    2020 1599   Otolith      2   452  994      702      994       NA       NA\n#R|  3257 1987   NA     Scale      2   240  435      155      352       NA       NA\n#R|  3258 1987   NA     Scale      3   305  531      137      331      431       NA\n#R|  3259 1987   NA     Scale      3   453  695      145      338      537       NA\n#R|       annulus5 annulus6 annulus7 annulus8 annulus9 annulus10 annulus11\n#R|  1          NA       NA       NA       NA       NA        NA        NA\n#R|  2          NA       NA       NA       NA       NA        NA        NA\n#R|  3          NA       NA       NA       NA       NA        NA        NA\n#R|  3257       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA        NA        NA\n#R|  3258       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA        NA        NA\n#R|  3259       NA       NA       NA       NA       NA        NA        NA\n\n\nThese data are in what I call “one-fish-per-line” format. This is the “tidy” format for performing analyses on a fish, but it is not in a “tidy” format for performing analyses on lengths at specific ages. This will become more evident in the following sections.\nFor consideration below, note that Structure contains only Scale and Otolith.\n\nunique(dat$Structure)\n\n#R|  [1] \"Otolith\" \"Scale\"\n\n\n\n\nBack-Calculation\nThe authors used the Dahl-Lea method of back-calculation for otoliths and the Fraser-Lee method for scales.2 The length adjustment term in the Fraser-Lee method came from the intercept of the regression of length-at-capture on scale radius-at-capture. This regression is performed using the “per fish” data in dat, but filtered to only the data from scales. The intercept is extracted from the regression results and stored in a for use below.2 I assume the reader is familiar with back-calculation methods. If not see here or examine the methods in McCarrick et al. (2022).\n\nLonR <- lm(capTL~edge,data=filter(dat,Structure==\"Scale\"))\n( a <- coef(LonR)[[\"(Intercept)\"]] )\n\n#R|  [1] 54.99758\n\n\nBack-calculating length at a previous age requires the data to be in a “one-annulus-per-line” format. For this purpose, the data in dat is considered “wide” (annuli are in multiple columns of each row) and need to be “pivoted” to “long” format with pivot_longer(). The columns that contain the annular measurements are given to cols=, values_to= gets a name for the column to contain these annular measurements, and names_to= gets a name for the column to contain the “label” for the annular measurements. The new bcAge variable (from names_to=) will contain the old columns names (i.e., “annulus 1”, “annulus 2”, etc.) by default. names_prefix= is used below to remove “annulus” from these labels and leave just the numeric age labels (e.g., “1”, “2”, etc.). The age “labels” are converted to numeric values with as.numeric() in mutate(). Finally, many rows in the new Radius variable will be missing because annular measurements were not made for ages older than the age-at-capture for the fish (e.g., Radius will be missing for all ages greater than 3 for an age-3 fish). These rows are removed with filter() below.\n\ndat2 <- dat |>\n  pivot_longer(cols=annulus1:annulus11,values_to=\"Radius\",\n               names_to=\"bcAge\",names_prefix=\"annulus\") |>\n  mutate(bcAge=as.numeric(bcAge)) |>\n  filter(!is.na(Radius))\n\nFSA::headtail(dat2)\n\n#R|       Year  ID Structure capAge capTL edge bcAge Radius\n#R|  1    2020 143   Otolith      3   402  982     1    464\n#R|  2    2020 143   Otolith      3   402  982     2    754\n#R|  3    2020 143   Otolith      3   402  982     3    982\n#R|  8754 1987  NA     Scale      3   453  695     1    145\n#R|  8755 1987  NA     Scale      3   453  695     2    338\n#R|  8756 1987  NA     Scale      3   453  695     3    537\n\n\nThis data frame is now prepared to back-calculate lengths at previous ages from the measurements in Radius, the structure size-at-capture in edge, and the fish’s length at capture in capTL. This calculation is somewhat complicated by the fact that different back-calculation equations are used depending on the structure examined. This is handled below using case_when() within mutate().\n\ndat2 <- dat2 |>\n  mutate(bcTL=case_when(\n    Structure==\"Scale\" ~ ((capTL-a)/edge)*Radius+a,\n    Structure==\"Otolith\" ~ capTL*Radius/edge\n  ))\n\nFSA::headtail(dat2)\n\n#R|       Year  ID Structure capAge capTL edge bcAge Radius     bcTL\n#R|  1    2020 143   Otolith      3   402  982     1    464 189.9470\n#R|  2    2020 143   Otolith      3   402  982     2    754 308.6640\n#R|  3    2020 143   Otolith      3   402  982     3    982 402.0000\n#R|  8754 1987  NA     Scale      3   453  695     1    145 138.0341\n#R|  8755 1987  NA     Scale      3   453  695     2    338 248.5585\n#R|  8756 1987  NA     Scale      3   453  695     3    537 362.5189\n\n\nAt this point, I felt the need to see if these calculations “worked.” I made a plot of back-calculated length-at-age and noticed that most results were reasonable, but there were a handful of VERY large back-calculated lengths. This seemed like date error rather than systematic calculation error. I was further concerned that there may be errors of very low back-calculated lengths; thus, I used a log scale for the y-axis.\n\nggplot(data=dat2,mapping=aes(x=bcAge,y=bcTL,color=Structure)) +\n  geom_jitter(width=0.2,height=0,alpha=0.5) +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans=\"log10\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe large back-calculated lengths were from four individual fish, three of which had lengths-at-capture that were clearly errors (i.e., capTL over 2000 mm). Additionally, at least two of the small back-calculated lengths were from errors in length-at-capture (i.e., capTL less that 50 mm). A few of the other problems appeared related to bad edge measurements.\n\ndat2 |> filter(bcTL>1000)\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 13 × 9\n#R|      Year    ID Structure capAge capTL  edge bcAge Radius  bcTL\n#R|     <dbl> <dbl> <chr>      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>\n#R|   1  2012  2055 Otolith        2  2778   665     1    394 1646.\n#R|   2  2012  2055 Otolith        2  2778   665     2    665 2778 \n#R|   3  2009   208 Otolith        3  3370   740     1    344 1567.\n#R|   4  2009   208 Otolith        3  3370   740     2    547 2491.\n#R|   5  2009   208 Otolith        3  3370   740     3    740 3370 \n#R|   6  2008    69 Otolith        4  4692   925     1    352 1785.\n#R|   7  2008    69 Otolith        4  4692   925     2    531 2693.\n#R|   8  2008    69 Otolith        4  4692   925     3    726 3683.\n#R|   9  2008    69 Otolith        4  4692   925     4    925 4692 \n#R|  10  2004  1098 Otolith        4   460   100     1    333 1532.\n#R|  11  2004  1098 Otolith        4   460   100     2    619 2847.\n#R|  12  2004  1098 Otolith        4   460   100     3    811 3731.\n#R|  13  2004  1098 Otolith        4   460   100     4   1000 4600\n\ndat2 |> filter(bcTL<80)\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 10 × 9\n#R|      Year    ID Structure capAge capTL  edge bcAge Radius  bcTL\n#R|     <dbl> <dbl> <chr>      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>\n#R|   1  2014    19 Otolith        2   145   610     1    313 74.4 \n#R|   2  2008   257 Otolith        2    15   667     1    321  7.22\n#R|   3  2008   257 Otolith        2    15   667     2    667 15   \n#R|   4  2006   149 Otolith        3    43   938     1    363 16.6 \n#R|   5  2006   149 Otolith        3    43   938     2    636 29.2 \n#R|   6  2006   149 Otolith        3    43   938     3    938 43   \n#R|   7  2007   319 Otolith        2   302  7110     1    374 15.9 \n#R|   8  2007   319 Otolith        2   302  7110     2    710 30.2 \n#R|   9  2004   135 Otolith        3   160   986     1    482 78.2 \n#R|  10  2004   218 Otolith        3   190   841     1    305 68.9\n\n\nI examined the length-at-capture and radius-at-capture data more closely.\n\nggplot(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=capTL)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=100) +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans=\"log10\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,10))\n## <100 and >1000 seem to be errors\n\nggplot(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=edge)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=100) +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans=\"log10\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,10))\n## <200? and >1500 seem to be errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this analysis, it seems that lengths-at-capture less than 100 mm and greater than 1000 mm are data errors.

If I had access to the original records, I would attempt to determine if these are data entry errors and fix them. I don’t have that access, so I deleted fish with these measurements from the dat data frame.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  filter(capTL>100,capTL<1000) |>\n  filter(edge>200,edge<3000)\n\nBecause the original dat data frame has now been altered, the regression and creation of dat2 above needed to be repeated before continuing.

Note that the x-axis variables should not be numeric, which is why Decade was converted to a factor above. Because of this, the x-axis is modified with scale_x_discrete() rather than scale_x_continuous(). The rest of functions used here were described in the previous posts related to McCarrick et al. (2022).\n\nggplot(data=dat3,mapping=aes(x=Decade,y=bcTL)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_text(mapping=aes(label=paste(\"Age\",bcAge)),check_overlap=TRUE,\n            x=Inf,y=Inf,vjust=1.2,hjust=1.1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Back-calculated length (mm)\",\n                     limits=c(100,700),breaks=scales::breaks_width(100),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(name=\"Decade\") +\n  lemon::facet_rep_wrap(vars(bcAge),ncol=1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecreating Figure 7\nFigure 7 is a bar chart based on summarized data, which needs to be constructed from dat2. Below, dat2 is restricted to only otoliths, the two periods shown in Figure 7 are created and converted to a factor, and then the sample size and the mean and standard error of back-calculated total lengths are calculated by age for each period. .drop=FALSE is used in group_by() so that the same number of ages will be shown for both periods, though both periods don’t have the same range of ages.3 This will make the bars in the plot before appear in their proper locations even if a result is missing for the other period.3 So, some ages will have NA for the mean and SE.\n\ndat4 <- dat2 |> \n  filter(Structure==\"Otolith\") |>\n  mutate(Period=ifelse(Year<2011,\"2002-2010\",\"2011-2020\"),\n         Period=factor(Period,levels=c(\"2002-2010\",\"2011-2020\")),\n         bcAge=factor(bcAge)) |>\n  group_by(Period,bcAge,.drop=FALSE) |>\n  summarize(n=n(),\n            mnTL=mean(bcTL,na.rm=TRUE),\n            seTL=FSA::se(bcTL,na.rm=TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup()\nFSA::headtail(dat4)\n\n#R|        Period bcAge    n     mnTL       seTL\n#R|  1  2002-2010     1 1190 174.2867  0.9124273\n#R|  2  2002-2010     2 1048 302.2455  1.2765006\n#R|  3  2002-2010     3  455 405.1318  2.2456338\n#R|  20 2011-2020     9    4 498.3248 29.0737028\n#R|  21 2011-2020    10    4 534.1058 26.7635020\n#R|  22 2011-2020    11    1 524.0000         NA\n\n\nThese summary data are then ready to make a bar chart, very similar to what was done in this post. Note here, though, that the width of the bars (in geom_col()) was reduced to create more room between the bars at each age. The width= of dodging in position_dodge() had to then be reduced a commensurate amount so that the bars at each age would touch. Finally, legend.key.width= and legend.key.height= were used in theme() to make the elongated “keys” in the legend as was done in Figure 7.\n\npd <- position_dodge(width=0.7)\n\nggplot(dat=dat4,mapping=aes(x=bcAge,y=mnTL,fill=Period)) +\n  geom_errorbar(mapping=aes(ymin=mnTL-seTL,ymax=mnTL+seTL),\n                position=pd,width=0.5) +\n  geom_col(position=pd,color=\"black\",width=0.7) +\n  scale_x_discrete(name=\"Age (years)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Mean back-calculated length (mm)\",\n                     limits=c(0,600),breaks=scales::breaks_width(100),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"2002-2010\"=\"gray10\",\"2011-2020\"=\"gray70\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_blank(),\n        legend.position=c(0,1),\n        legend.justification=c(-0.1,1.1),\n        legend.title=element_blank(),\n        legend.key.width=unit(15,units=\"mm\"),\n        legend.key.height=unit(3,units=\"mm\"),\n        legend.text=element_text(size=11))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI am not a fan of showing “error bars” that are only one SE. This is akin to showing a 68% confidence interval, which is not something that someone would usually do. I did that here because that is what was done in the published Figure 7, but I urge you not to do this … show a proper confidence interval instead.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMcCarrick, D.

    "text": "Making a Data Frame of Predicted Probabilities\nThe first step in recreating Figure 2 is to create a data frame of predicted probabilities, with 95% confidence intervals, for the occurrence of Virginia Opossums in the diet across the range of observed KFIi values. I begin this process by creating a data frame that has a KFI_i variable2 with a sequence of 199 values3 from the minimum to maximum observed KFIi values.2 This variable name must be exactly as it was in the data frame used in glm() above.3 The larger this number, the smoother the resultant curve in the figure will be.\n\nKFI_i_df <- data.frame(KFI_i=seq(min(dat$KFI_i),max(dat$KFI_i),length.out=199))\nhead(KFI_i_df)\n\n#R|        KFI_i\n#R|  1  9.560078\n#R|  2  9.848166\n#R|  3 10.136254\n#R|  4 10.424343\n#R|  5 10.712431\n#R|  6 11.000519\n\n\nPredicted values may be obtained with predict(), but for logistic regression interval=\"confidence\" is not supported, so corresponding confidence interval values are not automatically computed. However, predict() can be used to make predictions, with standard errors, on the logit-transformed scale, which can then be used to “manually” calculate confidence intervals. The predictions on the logit-transformed scale and the corresponding standard errors are returned by including type=\"link\" and se.fit=TRUE. predict() returns a list by default, but I forced it into a data frame below for easier manipulation further below.44 For our purposes, ignore the residual.scale column.\n\npredOpo <- predict(glmOpo,KFI_i_df,type=\"link\",se.fit=TRUE) |>\n  as.data.frame()\nhead(predOpo)\n\n#R|         fit    se.fit residual.scale\n#R|  1 -2.63952 0.3936826              1\n#R|  2 -2.62511 0.3897950              1\n#R|  3 -2.61070 0.3859143              1\n#R|  4 -2.59629 0.3820407              1\n#R|  5 -2.58188 0.3781745              1\n#R|  6 -2.56747 0.3743157              1\n\n\nIt is important to note here that the fit values in this data frame are on the logit-transformed scale. These values can be back-transformed to predicted probabilities using the inverse_logit() function created above.\n\npredOpo <- predOpo |>\n  mutate(predProb=inverse_logit(fit))\nhead(predOpo)\n\n#R|         fit    se.fit residual.scale   predProb\n#R|  1 -2.63952 0.3936826              1 0.06663790\n#R|  2 -2.62511 0.3897950              1 0.06753978\n#R|  3 -2.61070 0.3859143              1 0.06845296\n#R|  4 -2.59629 0.3820407              1 0.06937757\n#R|  5 -2.58188 0.3781745              1 0.07031373\n#R|  6 -2.56747 0.3743157              1 0.07126156\n\n\nApproximate 95% confidence intervals for the logit-transformed predictions can be made by adding and subtracting 1.96 times the standard error from each predicted value.5 These values are then back-transformed to construct confidence intervals on the probability scale.5 1.96 comes from normal distribution theory.\n\npredOpo <- predOpo |>\n  mutate(predLCI=inverse_logit(fit-1.96*se.fit),\n         predUCI=inverse_logit(fit+1.96*se.fit))\nhead(predOpo)\n\n#R|         fit    se.fit residual.scale   predProb    predLCI   predUCI\n#R|  1 -2.63952 0.3936826              1 0.06663790 0.03194919 0.1337847\n#R|  2 -2.62511 0.3897950              1 0.06753978 0.03263760 0.1345735\n#R|  3 -2.61070 0.3859143              1 0.06845296 0.03333990 0.1353679\n#R|  4 -2.59629 0.3820407              1 0.06937757 0.03405632 0.1361679\n#R|  5 -2.58188 0.3781745              1 0.07031373 0.03478710 0.1369735\n#R|  6 -2.56747 0.3743157              1 0.07126156 0.03553248 0.1377849\n\n\nFinally, I “bind as columns” the original data frame of KFIi values and select (and slightly re-arrange) the variables needed to make the figure.\n\npredOpo <- predOpo |>\n  bind_cols(KFI_i_df) |>\n  select(KFI_i,predProb,predLCI,predUCI)\nhead(predOpo)\n\n#R|        KFI_i   predProb    predLCI   predUCI\n#R|  1  9.560078 0.06663790 0.03194919 0.1337847\n#R|  2  9.848166 0.06753978 0.03263760 0.1345735\n#R|  3 10.136254 0.06845296 0.03333990 0.1353679\n#R|  4 10.424343 0.06937757 0.03405632 0.1361679\n#R|  5 10.712431 0.07031373 0.03478710 0.1369735\n#R|  6 11.000519 0.07126156 0.03553248 0.1377849\n\n\nThe steps above were separated to show the process.

These are the data required to reconstruct one panel of Figure 2."

    "text": "Present Only Over the Range of the Group’s Data\nFigure 3 as created above and shown in Landry et al. (2022) implies the same range of hard mast index values in both seasons (i.e., the logistic regression model is presented over the same range of hard mast index values for both seasons). However, a summary of the range of hard mast index values for each season reveals very little overlap between the two seasons.\n\nsmry <- dat |>\n  group_by(Season) |>\n  summarize(n=n(),\n            minHM=min(HardMast,na.rm=TRUE),\n            maxHM=max(HardMast,na.rm=TRUE))\nsmry\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 2 × 4\n#R|    Season        n minHM maxHM\n#R|    <chr>     <int> <dbl> <dbl>\n#R|  1 2014-2015   150  26.9  33.5\n#R|  2 2015-2016   150  29.8  55.3\n\n\nMy preference is to show the model fits across the ranges observed within each season.

Names for the remaining variables were long and somewhat inconsistent so I renamed those to be shorter and consistent.22 Note that as.data.frame() is used to remove the tibble class returned from read_excel() that I don’t prefer.\n\ndf <- readxl::read_excel(\"quist_etal_2022.xlsx\",na=c(\"\",\".\")) |>\n  select(-contains(\"Confidence\")) |>\n  rename(scale_r1=`Reader_1_Scale_age`,\n         scale_r2=`Reader_2_Scale_age`,\n         scale_age=`Consensus_scale_age`,\n         soto_r1=`Reader_1_Sectioned_Otolith_age`,\n         soto_r2=`Reader_2_Sectioned_Otolith_age`,\n         soto_age=`Consensus_Sectioned_Otolith_Age`,\n         woto_r1=`Reader_1_Whole_Otolith_age`,\n         woto_r2=`Reader_2_Whole_Otolith_age`,\n         woto_age=`Consensus_Whole_Otolith`) |>\n  as.data.frame()\nhead(df)\n\n#R|    Length Year scale_r1 scale_r2 scale_age soto_r1 soto_r2 soto_age woto_r1\n#R|  1    168 2019        1        1         1       1       1        1      NA\n#R|  2    169 2019        1        1         1       1       1        1       1\n#R|  3    172 2019        1        2         1       2       1        1      NA\n#R|  4    175 2020        1        1         1       2       2        2       2\n#R|  5    178 2019        1        1         1       1       1        1       1\n#R|  6    216 2020        2        2         2       2       2        2      NA\n#R|    woto_r2 woto_age\n#R|  1      NA       NA\n#R|  2       1        1\n#R|  3      NA       NA\n#R|  4       1        1\n#R|  5       1        1\n#R|  6      NA       NA\n\n\nFigures 1 and 2 in Quist et al.

For example, there were three instances where each reader assigned an age of 1 and two instances where reader 1 assigned an age of 1 but reader 2 assigned and age of 2.\n\ndf_wo <- df |>\n  group_by(woto_r1,woto_r2) |>\n  summarize(freq=n()) |>\n  as.data.frame()\nhead(df_wo)\n\n#R|    woto_r1 woto_r2 freq\n#R|  1       1       1    3\n#R|  2       1       2    2\n#R|  3       2       1    2\n#R|  4       2       2  114\n#R|  5       2       3   28\n#R|  6       2       4    1\n\n\nagePrecision() from FSA was then used to compute a variety of age precision statistics between the two readers. For these purposes, note that exact percent agreement is returned in $PercAgree and the average coefficient of variation is returned in $ACV of the object saved from agePrecision().\n\nap_wo <- FSA::agePrecision(woto_r2~woto_r1,data=df)\nstr(ap_wo)\n\n#R|  List of 14\n#R|   $ detail   :'data.frame': 416 obs. of  12 variables:\n#R|    ..$ woto_r2: num [1:416] NA 1 NA 1 1 NA 2 2 1 2 ...\n#R|    ..$ woto_r1: num [1:416] NA 1 NA 2 1 NA 2 2 1 2 ...\n#R|    ..$ mean   : num [1:416] NA 1 NA 1.5 1 NA 2 2 1 2 ...\n#R|    ..$ median : num [1:416] NA 1 NA 1.5 1 NA 2 2 1 2 ...\n#R|    ..$ mode   : num [1:416] NA 1 NA NA 1 NA 2 2 1 2 ...\n#R|    ..$ SD     : num [1:416] NA 0 NA 0.707 0 ...\n#R|    ..$ CV     : num [1:416] NA 0 NA 47.1 0 ...\n#R|    ..$ CV2    : num [1:416] NA 0 NA 47.1 0 ...\n#R|    ..$ AD     : num [1:416] NA 0 NA 0.5 0 NA 0 0 0 0 ...\n#R|    ..$ PE     : num [1:416] NA 0 NA 33.3 0 ...\n#R|    ..$ PE2    : num [1:416] NA 0 NA 33.3 0 ...\n#R|    ..$ D      : num [1:416] NA 0 NA 33.3 0 ...\n#R|   $ rawdiff  : 'table' int [1:7(1d)] 2 36 248 82 6 0 1\n#R|    ..- attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 1\n#R|    .. ..$ : chr [1:7] \"-2\" \"-1\" \"0\" \"1\" ...\n#R|   $ absdiff  : 'table' int [1:5(1d)] 248 118 8 0 1\n#R|    ..- attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 1\n#R|    .. ..$ : chr [1:5] \"0\" \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" ...\n#R|   $ ASD      : num 0.26\n#R|   $ ACV      : num 7.81\n#R|   $ ACV2     : num 7.81\n#R|   $ AAD      : num 0.184\n#R|   $ APE      : num 5.52\n#R|   $ APE2     : num 5.52\n#R|   $ AD       : num 5.52\n#R|   $ PercAgree: num 66.1\n#R|   $ R        : int 2\n#R|   $ n        : int 416\n#R|   $ validn   : int 375\n#R|   - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"agePrec\"\n\n\nQuist et al. (2022) also reported “PA-1” (i.e., the percent agreement within one age), which is not returned by agePrecision(). This value can, however, be calculated by summing the first two values in $absDiff (these are the counts of perfect agreement and agreement within one age) and dividing by the total number of paired assignments in $validn.\n\nsum(ap_wo$absdiff[1:2])/ap_wo$validn*100\n\n#R|  [1] 97.6\n\n\nQuist et al. (2022) annotated their plots with these three summary values. Below I use str_glue() to concatenate together these values into a single string that will be added to the plots below. In the use of str_glue() below the three summary measures are assigned to objects named PA, PA1, and CV (last three lines) and those values are then inserted into the string (first four lines) within the {} delimiters. I also used formatC() is used to format the string to one decimal place and that \\n is a “carriage return” that starts a new line in the string.\n\nlbl_wo <- str_glue(\"Whole Otoliths\\n\",\n                   \"PA = {PA}%\\n\",\n                   \"PA-1 = {PA1}%\\n\",\n                   \"CV = {CV}\",\n                   PA=formatC(ap_wo$PercAgree,format='f',digits=1),\n                   PA1=formatC(sum(ap_wo$absdiff[1:2])/ap_wo$validn*100,format='f',digits=1),\n                   CV=formatC(ap_wo$ACV,format='f',digits=1))\nlbl_wo\n\n#R|  Whole Otoliths\n#R|  PA = 66.1%\n#R|  PA-1 = 97.6%\n#R|  CV = 7.8\n\n\nFinally, the plot is made by first3 adding the 1:1 reference line with geom_a line(), the frequency of age estimates with geom_label(), and the summary results as text with annotate(). The arguments in geom_label() remove the rounded edges of the boxes (i.e., label.r) and attempt to make the boxes larger to more closely abut as in Quist et al. (2022). The arguments in annotate() put the label at the minimum x and maximum y values, then vertically and horizontally adjust that text box so that the upper-left corner is just inside the upper-left corner of the plot. Finally, the expansion factors are removed from both axes and both axes are limited to and labeled with the limits and labels set above.3 So that it appears behind the numbers.\n\nrs_wo <- ggplot(data=df_wo,mapping=aes(x=woto_r1,y=woto_r2,label=freq)) +\n  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0) +\n  geom_label(label.r=unit(0,\"lines\"),label.padding=unit(0.3,\"lines\")) +\n  annotate(geom=\"text\",label=lbl_wo,\n           x=0,y=12,hjust=-0.1,vjust=1.1,size=4) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Reader 1\",expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=axlmts,breaks=axlbls) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Reader 2\",expand=expansion(mult=0),\n                     limits=axlmts,breaks=axlbls) +\n  theme_q()\nrs_wo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nI did not find a good way to make the boxes around each value the same size as in Quist et al. (2022).\nAlso, I think that graphs with the same rnge of values on both axes should be presented as a square, rather than as the rectangle used by Quist et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecreating Figure 1\nThe code described above can largely be repeated for scales and sectioned otoliths, which I did without showing the code but saving the results in ggplot2 objects called rs_sc and rs_so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when these two objects are combined together with rs_wo to form Figure 1, they should not have a title or labels for the x-axis. The x-axis title and labels are removed by setting axis.title.x= and axis.text.x= in theme() to element_blank() and appending this to each object.44 Note that each object is modified and then saved to the same name here.\n\nrs_so <- rs_so +\n  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x=element_blank())\nrs_sc <- rs_sc +\n  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x=element_blank())\n\nFinally, the three plots can be stacked on top of each other using patchwork as shown below.55 Use smaller values in plot.margin= in theme_q to more closely resemble how close the panels are in Quist et al. (2022).\n\nrs_sc + rs_so + rs_wo +\n  plot_layout(ncol=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecreating Figure 2\nFigure 2 would follow the same general process as Figure 1 except that the summary results annotation would only have the results and not a “title” and each panel in the figure would have the x-axis title and labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nQuist, M.

    "text": "Introduction\nQuist et al. (2022) examined three structures (scales, sectioned otoliths, and whole otoliths) to estimate age of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri). In a previous post I largely recreated their Figures 1 and 2 related to age precision and bias between readers and between structures. In this post I attempt to recreate their Figure 3 which examined back-calculated lengths-at-age between structures (and observed lengths-at-age).\n \n\n\nGetting Setup\nThe following packages are loaded for use below.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # for dplyr, ggplot2 packages\n\nThe following ggplot2 theme was used below.11 See this post for more information on creating and using ggplot2 themes.\n\ntheme_q <- function(base_size=14) {\n  theme_bw(base_size=base_size) +\n    theme(\n      # margin for the plot\n      plot.margin=unit(c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5),\"cm\"),\n      # set axis label (i.e., title) colors and margins\n      axis.title.y=element_text(colour=\"black\",margin=margin(t=0,r=10,b=0,l=0)),\n      axis.title.x=element_text(colour=\"black\",margin=margin(t=10,r=0,b=0,l=0)),\n      # set tick label color, margin, and position and orientation\n      axis.text.y=element_text(colour=\"black\",margin=margin(t=0,r=5,b=0,l=0),\n                               vjust=0.5,hjust=1),\n      axis.text.x=element_text(colour=\"black\",margin=margin(t=5,r=0,b=0,l=0),\n                               vjust=0,hjust=0.5,),\n      # set size of the tick marks for y- and x-axis\n      axis.ticks=element_line(linewidth=0.5),\n      # adjust length of the tick marks\n      axis.ticks.length=unit(0.2,\"cm\"),\n      # set the axis size,color,and end shape\n      axis.line=element_line(colour=\"black\",linewidth=0.5,lineend=\"square\"),\n      # adjust size of text for legend\n      legend.text=element_text(size=12),\n      # remove grid\n      panel.grid=element_blank()\n    )\n}\n\n \n\n\nData\nUnfortunately data for constructing Figure 3 was not provided along with the published paper.2 Thus, I simulated similar data using my FSAsim package. Given that FSAsim is a work-in-progress I don’t show the code for simulating the data. However, the data can be downloaded as a CSV file from here.2 The supplement with the published paper only included the age estimates data.\n\n\n\nThe resultant df data frame has the following four variables:\n\nstrux: Identifies the structure used to assign age (sectioned otoliths or scales), or whether the data are observed lengths and ages.\nid: Unique fish identifier (not used in this analysis).\nage: Age-at-capture for observed data or an age back-calculated to for otoliths and scales.\nlen: Length-at-capture for observed data or a back-calculated length for otoliths and scales.\n\n\nFSA::peek(df,n=10)\n\n#R|         strux  id age len\n#R|  1   otoliths   1   1 178\n#R|  80  otoliths  25   4 326\n#R|  159 otoliths  53   3 464\n#R|  239 otoliths  73   1 202\n#R|  319 otoliths  95   5 371\n#R|  398   scales  19   1 262\n#R|  478   scales  46   1 254\n#R|  558   scales  77   2 283\n#R|  637 observed  20   6 444\n#R|  717 observed 100   3 353\n\n\n \n\n\nRecreating Figure 3\nFigure 3 in Quist et al. (2022) is a boxplot. geom_boxplot() in ggplot2 requires that the x-axis variable be “discrete” (or categorical). Thus, a new variable, fage, is created that is a factored (i.e., categorical) version of age. Additionally, the order of strux is alphabetical by default, which is not the order plotted by Quist et al. (2022). Thus, strux is modified below to set the order of the levels.\n\ndf <- df |>\n  mutate(fage=factor(age),\n         strux=factor(strux,levels=c(\"scales\",\"otoliths\",\"observed\")))\n\nThe default use of geom_boxplot() gets us close to Figure 3 in Quist et al. (2022).\n\nggplot(data=df,mapping=aes(x=fage,y=len,fill=strux)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_x_discrete(name=\"Age (yrs)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Length (mm)\",\n                     limits=c(0,600),breaks=seq(0,600,100),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  theme_q()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we need to adjust the colors used, remove the legend, narrow the boxes, put “caps” on the ends of the whiskers, and change the outliers to open circles.\nThe colors to be used are defined in the named vector clrs below. This will be given to scale_fill_manual() below.\n\nclrs <- c(\"scales\"=\"white\",\"otoliths\"=\"gray80\",\"observed\"=\"gray40\")\n\nThe width of the boxes is set in boxwid and the width of the “caps” on the whisker is set at 80% of this box width. The distance between adjacent boxes at the same age is controlled with position= with a function called position_dodge(). It was not clear to me what to set these values to but I settled on the following after a little back-and-forth tinkering.33 The dodge width should be larger than the box width so that the boxes don’t touch.\n\nboxwid <- 0.4                       # box width\ncapwid <- 0.8*boxwid                # whisker cap width\nboxsep <- position_dodge(width=0.5) # dodge amount between boxes\n\nThe use of stat_boxplot() below is a trick to put an “error bar” behind the boxplot, which gives the impression that the whiskers are “capped” (i.e., the error bar caps are in the same place that the whisker caps would be). The shape4, boundary color, and fill for the outlier marks are defined with outlier.shape=, outlier.color=, and outlier.fill=, respectively. Finally, show.legend=FALSE in geom_boxplot() is used to remove the legend.4 “21” means a circle that has both a boundary and a fill color.\n\nggplot(data=df,mapping=aes(x=fage,y=len,fill=strux)) +\n  stat_boxplot(geom=\"errorbar\",width=capwid,position=boxsep) +\n  geom_boxplot(width=boxwid,position=boxsep,\n               outlier.shape=21,outlier.color=\"black\",outlier.fill=\"white\",\n               show.legend=FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=clrs) +\n  scale_x_discrete(name=\"Age (yrs)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Length (mm)\",\n                     limits=c(0,600),breaks=seq(0,600,100),\n                     expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  theme_q()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nQuist, M.

I also set the random number seed for reproducibility of the randomly generated sample data below.\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)    # for group_by(), summarize(), mutate(), right_join()\nlibrary(tidyr)    # for complete(), nesting()\nset.seed(678394)  # for reproducibility of randomly created data\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nMuch of my work is with undergraduates who are first learning to analyze fisheries data. A common “learning opportunity” occurs when students are asked to compute the mean catch (or CPE), along with a standard deviation (SD), across multiple gear sets for each species. The learning opportunity occurs because some species will invariably not be caught in some gear sets. When the students summarize the number of fish caught for each species in each gear set those species not caught in a particular gear set will not “appear” in their data. Thus, when calculating the mean, the student will get the correct numerator (sum of catch across all gear sets) but not denominator (they use number of catches summed rather than total number of gear sets), which inflates (over-estimates) the mean catch and (usually) deflates (under-estimates) the SD of catches. Once confronted with this issue, they easily realize how to correct the mean calculation, but calculating the standard deviation is still an issue. These problems are exacerbated when using software to compute these summary statistics across many individual gear sets.\nIn software, the “trick” is to add a zero for each species not caught in a specific gear set that was caught in at least one gear set. For example, if Bluegill were caught in at least one gear set but not in the third gear set, then a zero must be added as the catch of Bluegill in the third gear set. The addZeroCatch() function in the FSA package was an attempt to efficiently add these zeroes. This function has proven useful over the years, but I have become dissatisfied with its clunkiness. Additionally, I recently became aware of the complete() function in the tidyr package which holds promise for handling the same task. In this post, I explore the use of complete() for handling this issue.\n \n\n\nSimple Data\nIn this first example, the data consists of species and length recorded for each captured fish organized by the gear set identification number (ID) and held in the fishdat data.frame.\n\n\n#R|    ID species  tl\n#R|  1  1     BLG 148\n#R|  2  1     BLG 153\n#R|  3  1     BLG 147\n#R|  4  1     BLG 149\n#R|  5  1     BLG 144\n#R|  6  1     BLG 145\n\n\nThe catch of each species in each gear set may be found using group_by() and summarize() with n().11  I find the tibble structure returned by group_by() to be annoying with simple data frames like this. Thus, I usually use as.data.frame() to remove it.\n\ncatch <- fishdat |>\n  group_by(ID,species) |>\n  summarize(num=n()) |>\n  as.data.frame()\ncatch\n\n#R|     ID species num\n#R|  1   1     BLG  10\n#R|  2   1     LMB   5\n#R|  3   1     YEP   5\n#R|  4   2     LMB   9\n#R|  5   2     YEP   7\n#R|  6   3     BLG  12\n#R|  7   3     YEP   7\n#R|  8   4     BLG   1\n#R|  9   4     LMB  11\n#R|  10  4     YEP  11\n#R|  11  5     BLG   9\n\n\nFrom this it is seen that three species (“BLG”, “LMB”, and “YEP”) were captured across all nets, but that “BLG” were not captured in “ID=2”, “LMB” were not captured in “ID=3”, and “LMB” and “YEP” were not captured in “ID=5”. The sample size, mean, and SD of catches per species from these data may be found by again using group_by() and summarize(). However, these calculations are INCORRECT because they do not include the zero catches of “BLG” in “ID=2”, “LMB” in “ID=3”, and “LMB” and “YEP” in “ID=5”. The problem is most evident in the sample sizes, which should be five (gear sets) for each species.\n\n## Example of INCORRECT summaries because not using zeroes\ncatch |> \n  group_by(species) |>\n  summarize(n=n(),mn=mean(num),sd=sd(num)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\n#R|    species n       mn       sd\n#R|  1     BLG 4 8.000000 4.830459\n#R|  2     LMB 3 8.333333 3.055050\n#R|  3     YEP 4 7.500000 2.516611\n\n\nThe complete() function can be used to add rows to a data frame for variables (or combinations of variables) that should be present in the data frame (relative to other values that are present) but are not. The complete() function takes a data frame as its first argument (but will be “piped” in below with |>) and the variable or variables that will be used to identify which items are missing. For example, with these data, a zero should be added to num for missing combinations defined by ID and species.\n\n## Example of default complete ... see below to add zeroes, not NAs\ncatch |>\n  complete(ID,species) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\n#R|     ID species num\n#R|  1   1     BLG  10\n#R|  2   1     LMB   5\n#R|  3   1     YEP   5\n#R|  4   2     BLG  NA\n#R|  5   2     LMB   9\n#R|  6   2     YEP   7\n#R|  7   3     BLG  12\n#R|  8   3     LMB  NA\n#R|  9   3     YEP   7\n#R|  10  4     BLG   1\n#R|  11  4     LMB  11\n#R|  12  4     YEP  11\n#R|  13  5     BLG   9\n#R|  14  5     LMB  NA\n#R|  15  5     YEP  NA\n\n\nFrom this result, it is seen that complete() added a row for “BLG” in “ID=2”, “LMB” in “ID=3”, and “LMB” and “YEP” in “ID=5” as we had hoped. However, complete() adds NAs by default. The value to add can be changed with fill=, which takes a list that includes the name of the variable to which the NAs were added (num in this case) set equal to the value to be added (0 in this case).22 Here the result is saved into the catch data frame, thus modifying the original data frame with the addition of the zeroes.\n\ncatch <- catch |>\n  complete(ID,species,fill=list(num=0)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\ncatch\n\n#R|     ID species num\n#R|  1   1     BLG  10\n#R|  2   1     LMB   5\n#R|  3   1     YEP   5\n#R|  4   2     BLG   0\n#R|  5   2     LMB   9\n#R|  6   2     YEP   7\n#R|  7   3     BLG  12\n#R|  8   3     LMB   0\n#R|  9   3     YEP   7\n#R|  10  4     BLG   1\n#R|  11  4     LMB  11\n#R|  12  4     YEP  11\n#R|  13  5     BLG   9\n#R|  14  5     LMB   0\n#R|  15  5     YEP   0\n\n\nThese correct catch data can then be summarized as above to show the correct sample size, mean, and SD of catches per species.\n\ncatch |>\n  group_by(species) |>\n  summarize(n=n(),mn=mean(num),sd=sd(num)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\n#R|    species n  mn       sd\n#R|  1     BLG 5 6.4 5.504544\n#R|  2     LMB 5 5.0 5.049752\n#R|  3     YEP 5 6.0 4.000000\n\n\n \n\n\nMultiple Values to Receive Zeroes\nSuppose that the fish data included a column that indicates whether the fish was marked and returned to the waterbody or not.\n\n\n#R|    ID species  tl marked\n#R|  1  1     BLG 148    YES\n#R|  2  1     BLG 153    YES\n#R|  3  1     BLG 147    YES\n#R|  4  1     BLG 149    YES\n#R|  5  1     BLG 144    YES\n#R|  6  1     BLG 145    YES\n\n\nThe catch and number of fish marked and returned per gear set ID and species may again be computed with group_by() and summarize(). Note, however, the use of ifelse() to use a 1 if the fish was marked and a 0 if it was not. Summing these values returns the number of fish that were marked. Giving this data frame to complete() as before will add zeroes for both the num and nmarked variables as long as both are included in the list given to fill=.\n\ncatch2 <- fishdat2 |>\n  group_by(ID,species) |>\n  summarize(num=n(),\n            nmarked=sum(ifelse(marked==\"YES\",1,0)))\ncatch2\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 11 × 4\n#R|  # Groups:   ID [5]\n#R|        ID species   num nmarked\n#R|     <dbl> <chr>   <int>   <dbl>\n#R|   1     1 BLG        10       8\n#R|   2     1 LMB         5       2\n#R|   3     1 YEP         5       2\n#R|   4     2 LMB         9       5\n#R|   5     2 YEP         7       2\n#R|   6     3 BLG        12       3\n#R|   7     3 YEP         7       4\n#R|   8     4 BLG         1       0\n#R|   9     4 LMB        11       4\n#R|  10     4 YEP        11       7\n#R|  11     5 BLG         9       6\n\n\nThere are two things to note in this output. First, that there are no zeroes for num and nmarked for the same species and gear sets as before. Second, the summarization was across two groups but summarize() only removes one of the group_by() variables. Thus, this result is still grouped by ID as shown above, which will interfere with using complete() to add the zeroes. This grouping can be removed with ungroup() as shown below before using complete().\n\ncatch2 <- catch2 |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  complete(ID,species,fill=list(num=0,nmarked=0)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\ncatch2\n\n#R|     ID species num nmarked\n#R|  1   1     BLG  10       8\n#R|  2   1     LMB   5       2\n#R|  3   1     YEP   5       2\n#R|  4   2     BLG   0       0\n#R|  5   2     LMB   9       5\n#R|  6   2     YEP   7       2\n#R|  7   3     BLG  12       3\n#R|  8   3     LMB   0       0\n#R|  9   3     YEP   7       4\n#R|  10  4     BLG   1       0\n#R|  11  4     LMB  11       4\n#R|  12  4     YEP  11       7\n#R|  13  5     BLG   9       6\n#R|  14  5     LMB   0       0\n#R|  15  5     YEP   0       0\n\n\n \n\n\nMore Information that Does Not Get Zeroes\nSuppose there is a data frame called geardat that contains information specific to each gear set.\n\n\n\n\ngeardat\n\n#R|    ID mon year  lake run effort\n#R|  1  1 May 2018 round   1   1.34\n#R|  2  2 May 2018 round   2   1.87\n#R|  3  3 May 2018 round   3   1.56\n#R|  4  4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92\n#R|  5  5 May 2018  twin   2   0.67\n\n\nAnd, for the purposes of this example, suppose that we have summarized catch data WITHOUT the zeroes having been added.\n\ncatch3 <- fishdat2 |>\n  group_by(ID,species) |>\n  summarize(num=n(),\n            nmarked=sum(ifelse(marked==\"YES\",1,0))) |>\n  as.data.frame()\ncatch3\n\n#R|     ID species num nmarked\n#R|  1   1     BLG  10       8\n#R|  2   1     LMB   5       2\n#R|  3   1     YEP   5       2\n#R|  4   2     LMB   9       5\n#R|  5   2     YEP   7       2\n#R|  6   3     BLG  12       3\n#R|  7   3     YEP   7       4\n#R|  8   4     BLG   1       0\n#R|  9   4     LMB  11       4\n#R|  10  4     YEP  11       7\n#R|  11  5     BLG   9       6\n\n\nFinally, suppose that these summarized catch data are joined with the gear data such that the gear set specific information is shown with each catch.\n\ncatch3 <- right_join(geardat,catch3,by=\"ID\")\ncatch3\n\n#R|     ID mon year  lake run effort species num nmarked\n#R|  1   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     BLG  10       8\n#R|  2   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     LMB   5       2\n#R|  3   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     YEP   5       2\n#R|  4   2 May 2018 round   2   1.87     LMB   9       5\n#R|  5   2 May 2018 round   2   1.87     YEP   7       2\n#R|  6   3 May 2018 round   3   1.56     BLG  12       3\n#R|  7   3 May 2018 round   3   1.56     YEP   7       4\n#R|  8   4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     BLG   1       0\n#R|  9   4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     LMB  11       4\n#R|  10  4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     YEP  11       7\n#R|  11  5 May 2018  twin   2   0.67     BLG   9       6\n\n\nThese data simulate what might be seen from a flat database.\nWith these data, zeroes still need to be added as defined by missing combinations of ID and species. However, if only these two variables are included in complete() then zeroes will be added for mon, year, lake, run, and effort, which is not desired. These five variables are connected to or “nested” with the ID variable (i.e., if you know ID then you know the values of these other variables) and should be treated as a group. Nesting of variables can be handled in complete() by including the names of all the connected variables in nesting().\n\ncatch3 |> complete(nesting(ID,mon,year,lake,run,effort),species,\n                    fill=list(num=0,nmarked=0)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\n#R|     ID mon year  lake run effort species num nmarked\n#R|  1   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     BLG  10       8\n#R|  2   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     LMB   5       2\n#R|  3   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     YEP   5       2\n#R|  4   2 May 2018 round   2   1.87     BLG   0       0\n#R|  5   2 May 2018 round   2   1.87     LMB   9       5\n#R|  6   2 May 2018 round   2   1.87     YEP   7       2\n#R|  7   3 May 2018 round   3   1.56     BLG  12       3\n#R|  8   3 May 2018 round   3   1.56     LMB   0       0\n#R|  9   3 May 2018 round   3   1.56     YEP   7       4\n#R|  10  4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     BLG   1       0\n#R|  11  4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     LMB  11       4\n#R|  12  4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     YEP  11       7\n#R|  13  5 May 2018  twin   2   0.67     BLG   9       6\n#R|  14  5 May 2018  twin   2   0.67     LMB   0       0\n#R|  15  5 May 2018  twin   2   0.67     YEP   0       0\n\n\nIt is possible to have nesting with species as well.

(1995) examined the population of harvestable Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) in Conner Cove of Lake Guntersville, Alabama (a 28,000 ha impoundment of the Tennessee River) in March, 1992. Their objective was to estimate the abundance of harvestable bass through the depletion of catches due to electrofishing. In their study, they electrofished for 15 minutes at each of four depth strata in Conner Cove. The total number of bass captured and removed from the population in the full hour of electrofishing at the four depths was recorded. Thus, a total of one hour of electrofishing constituted one unit of effort. Six one-hour periods were used to deplete the population of bass in one Conner Cove. The number of bass caught in each successive sampling period was 23, 12, 13, 14, 9, and 7. Enter these data into vectors in R and use them to answer the following questions.\n\nWhat is the best estimate and 95% confidence interval for the catchability coefficient? Very carefully interpret what this estimate means relative to Conner Cove Largemouth Bass.\nHow does your catchability estimate compare to that published in Maceina et al. (1995)?

Specifically, they examined the abundance of age-5 and older Walleye (spawning population), variation in May water temperatures, and abundance of 152.4 mm total length and longer Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) on the abundance of age-0 Walleye.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nNo special packages are loaded for use in this post.\n\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nA large number and variety of data sets are provided in the FSA and FSAdata packages, which I collectively call here the “fishR data.” Lists of the data available in these packages are available alphabetically ordered or arranged by fisheries topic.1 Items on those lists are linked to a documentation file where the origin of the data, its variables, and other items are described. This is a rich source of open-source data that can be used for teaching purposes.1 A more comprehensive list of fisheries data in all CRAN packages is here.\nData sets in FSA and FSAdata can be, as with data in all packages, accessed with data() by including the name of the data as the first argument and the package name in package=. For example, the WalleyeErie2 data from FSAdata are loaded below.\n\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nhead(WalleyeErie2)\n\n#R|      setID loc grid year  tl   w  sex    mat age\n#R|  1 2003001   1  940 2003 360 460 male mature   2\n#R|  2 2003001   1  940 2003 371 571 male mature   2\n#R|  3 2003001   1  940 2003 375 507 male mature   2\n#R|  4 2003001   1  940 2003 375 584 male mature   2\n#R|  5 2003001   1  940 2003 375 537 male mature   2\n#R|  6 2003001   1  940 2003 376 553 male mature   2\n\n\n \nWhile this method for accessing these data is efficient, I don’t like to use it with students because in the “real world” they will not be accessing data from an R package, rather they will be using their own data stored in some other format. With students just learning R I usually have them load CSV files that I either provide for them or they produce themselves.2 They then load the data with read.csv() from base R.32 We also discuss the advantages of CSV files – lightweight, not proprietary, etc.3 For more advanced students I will use read_csv() from readr.\n \n\n\nUsing CSV Files\nTo aid use of the fishR data as CSV files we have provided links to the raw CSV files in the R documentation,4 in the on-line documentation, or in the PDF documentation on CRAN. In all instances you will see a highlighted “CSV file” link at the end of the description in the “source” section of documentation (Figure 1). Pressing this link will bring up the raw CSV file which can then be saved to your personal computer.54 For example, (e.g., try ?FSAdata::WalleyeErie2.5 Alternatively, right-click on the CSV link to save the file.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Partial view of the online documentation for WalleyeErie2 data set in FSAdata showing the “CSV file” link.\n\n\n\n\n \nStudents can link directly to URL for the CSV file but this requires a connection to the internet (each time the data is loaded) and does not help students learn how to organize data on their own computers.\n\nWalleyeErie2 <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fishR-Core-Team/FSAdata/main/data-raw/WalleyeErie2.csv\")\nhead(WalleyeErie2)\n\n#R|      setID loc grid year  tl   w  sex    mat age\n#R|  1 2003001   1  940 2003 360 460 male mature   2\n#R|  2 2003001   1  940 2003 371 571 male mature   2\n#R|  3 2003001   1  940 2003 375 507 male mature   2\n#R|  4 2003001   1  940 2003 375 584 male mature   2\n#R|  5 2003001   1  940 2003 375 537 male mature   2\n#R|  6 2003001   1  940 2003 376 553 male mature   2\n\n\nHowever, this last example also demonstrates how an instructor could link directly to the CSV file in the resources they provide the student.\n \n\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, we hope you will take advantage of the data resources provided in the FSA and FSAdata packages. However, we encourage you not to have students access the data through data() but instead to use the CSV files linked to in the documentation as described above.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"

    "text": "Fish length is likely most commonly collected data by fisheries biologists and managers. While length is usually not the only information collected by a fisheries biologist, summaries of length information can provide the biologist with a wealth of information on population parameters such as age distributions, growth rates, and mortality rates; the basic biology of the animal; and the effect of management regulations on the fish population. Thus, summarizing length data and then interpreting those summaries is an important task performed by fisheries biologists.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring length of a Rainbow Trout.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWhittlesey Creek is a tributary to Chequamegon Bay of Lake Superior. This stream has been severely degraded by past land use practices including clear-cut logging and channelization to drain wetlands for farming. The “Coaster” Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), a lake-dwelling stream-spawning form of Brook Trout, was largely extirpated from southern Lake Superior and the Whittlesey Creek watershed due to over-fishing and habitat degradation. In 1999, the U.S., Fish and Wildlife Service established the Whittlesey Creek National Wildlife Refuge with a primary goal of reestablishing a population of Coaster Brook Trout in Whittlesey Creek. That effort has included experimental introductions of Brook Trout at various life stages and much work to restore habitat.\nIn July, 2011 a quarter-mile stretch of the lower Whittlesey Creek was modified with the addition of large woody debris with attached “root balls.” The goal of this project was to alter the morphology of this section of the stream to provide better habitat and water conditions for Brook Trout. In May, 2011 a group of students conducted two days of sampling with electrofishing gear to provide baseline information about the fish populations in this section of the stream. Their sampling yielded eight total Brook Trout but relatively larger numbers of Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and sculpins (primarily Slimy Sculpin (Cottus cognatus), but some Mottled Sculpin (Cottus bairdii)). Data from catches of Coho Salmon, Rainbow Trout, and sculpins will be analyzed in this case study.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents backpack electrofishing a stream.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nData from the sampling collected by the students were stored in Whittlesey2011.csv. The variables in this data set are defined as follows:\n\nstudy: The name of the study.\nnetID: A unique label for each day of sampling.\nsDate: The date of sampling.\nrun: A factor indicating if the sample was the marking or recapture run.\nspecies: A factor indicating the species captured. Options are Species1, Species2, or Species3. This variable will be discussed in more detail later.\nlength: The total length of the sampled fish to the nearest mm.\nclipped: Indicates if the fish was clipped (=1) or not. All fish in the recapture run were not clipped.\nrecap: Indicates if the fish was previously clipped (i.e., a “recapture”; =1) or not. All fish in the marking run could not possibly be a recaptured fish.\nnotes: Any specific notes about that particular fish."

    "text": "Motivation\nStudents (and biologists for that matter!) have a tendency to accept sampling data at face value. If a gear type primarily collects small fish then they assume the population is dominated by small fish. If a gear type captures big fish and lots of them then they assume that the population is dominated by large fish. In reality, many biases are possible and are actually very common. To truly understand sampling data, biologists must first understand the biases associated with each gear, and only then will the true nature of the population’s structure (e.g., size or age structure) and dynamics (i.e., recruitment, growth, and mortality) be revealed.\nVarious sampling gears may be differentially effective for different species, and even differentially effective for different sizes of the same species. For example, Largemouth Bass are commonly sampled with electrofishing gear. The numbers and sizes of Largemouth Bass collected can vary widely across seasons. During the spring and fall, more and larger Largemouth Bass tend to be nearshore and vulnerable to the electrofishing gear, which is used in that shallow-water habitat. During midsummer, fewer Largemouth Bass would be sampled at the same locations because many of the larger bass will have moved offshore to deeper water as a result of the warm summer water temperatures.\nIn this case study, you will explore the differential size structure of Bluegills captured by two common sampling gears – electrofishing and trap nets (also known as modified fyke nets).\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents lifting a trap (modified fyke) net."

    "text": "Daily bag or creel limits are the maximum number of fish an angler is allowed to harvest on a daily basis. For example, a bag limit of six Walleye would limit an angler to six or fewer harvested Walleye on a given day. Bag limits are a common management tool in many fisheries, especially in inland freshwater fisheries.\nRestrictive bag limits may be implemented for a variety of reasons. Most commonly it is thought that limiting the maximum number of fish an angler can harvest will reduce harvest, lower fishing mortality, and prevent over-exploitation of the fish population. However, bag limits have also been implemented to attempt to equitably distribute harvest among more anglers, provide anglers the satisfaction of reaching a goal (e.g., “I got my limit”), and to remind anglers that fish populations are a finite resource.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn angler’s harvest of Bluegill.\n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise, you will examine creel data (i.e., number of fish harvested by anglers) to determine how reducing the daily bag limit effects overall fish harvest.\n\n\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MnDNR) conducted statewide creel surveys over a 17 year period (Cook et al. 2001). The data, available in CreelMN1 records the species and number of fish harvested per angler (in one day). The data are limited to only six species2 – Walleye (WAE), Largemouth Bass (LMB), Northern Pike (NOP), Crappies (Black, White, and hybrids combined), Sunfish (Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, etc.), and Yellow Perch (YEP).1 See “CSV file” link in “Source” section of linked page.2 Acronyms are how the species appear in the data.\nThe following daily bag limits were in place during the study:\n\n6 Walleye\n6 Largemouth Bass\n3 Northern Pike\n15 Crappies\n30 Sunfish\n100 Yellow Perch"

    "title": "Miller et al. (2022) CPE Plot",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Series Note\n\n\n\nThis is the first of several posts related to Miller et al. (2022). I thank the authors for making their data available with their publication.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nMiller et al. (2022) examined life history characteristics of Goldeye (Hiodon alosoides) in two Kansas reservoirs. Their Figure 1 displayed a time series of catch-per-unit-effort (CPE) from 1997 to 2020 for both reservoirs, including a regression line to demonstrate the decline in abundance. I use ggplot2 here to recreate both figures.\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. A few functions from each of readxl, FSA, scales, and rstatix are used with :: such that the entire packages are not attached here.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # for dplyr, ggplot2 packages\nlibrary(ggtext)     # for use of markdown in text/labels\n\n \n\n\nData Wrangling\nMiller et al. (2022) provided the raw data for producing Figure 1 in the Data Supplement S1, which I loaded below. I converted the “reservoir” (impd) variable to a factor, reordered the levels so that the facets created below would be in the order used by the authors, and replaced the reservoir abbreviations with their longer names/labels.\n\ndat <- read.csv(\"JFWM-21-090.S1.csv\") |>\n  mutate(impd=factor(impd,levels=c(\"MILR\",\"LOVR\"),labels=c(\"Milford\",\"Lovewell\")))\n\nFSA::headtail(dat)\n\n#R|         impd   yr fish nets net_area_m2   catch_m2\n#R|  1  Lovewell 1997  496   16    1189.158 0.41710171\n#R|  2  Lovewell 1998  499   16    1189.158 0.41962450\n#R|  3  Lovewell 1999  324   16    1189.158 0.27246160\n#R|  45  Milford 2017   73   20     891.870 0.08185049\n#R|  46  Milford 2018   10   20     891.870 0.01121240\n#R|  47  Milford 2020   49   20     891.870 0.05494074\n\n\nI double-checked to make sure that the provided CPE variable (catch_m2) was equal to catch (fish) divided by the areal effort (net_area_m2).11 all_equal() checks equality between two vectors with a tolerance for machine precision.\n\nall.equal(dat$fish/dat$net_area_m2,dat$catch_m2)\n\n#R|  [1] TRUE\n\n\nThese data are ready to recreate Figure 1.\n \n\n\nRecreating Figure 1\n\nBasic Plot with Regression Line\nThe basic time series plot is created with geom_line() by mapping yr to the x-axis and catch_m2 to the y-axis, and using a shade of gray and slightly thicker line to match the authors’ choices. A linear regression is added with geom_smooth() using method=\"lm\".2 Here se=FALSE was used so a confidence band is not shown, and the line was changed to dashed, made black,3 and made a little thicker than the time series line to match the authors’ choices. A facet based on impd was created with ncol=1 to stack the two plots and scales=\"free_x\" so that labeled ticks would appear on the x-axis of both facets. Finally, the y-axis was labelled (more on this below), both axis limits were controlled and were expanded in a way to try to match the authors’ choices, and the basic black-and-white theme was added.2 The default is to add a loess smoother, lm is for a linear model.3 It defaults to blue.\n\nggplot(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=yr,y=catch_m2)) +\n  geom_line(color=\"gray50\",linewidth=1) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",se=FALSE,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"black\",linewidth=1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(impd),ncol=1,scales=\"free_x\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Catch/m^2^\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0.02,0.10))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1995,2020),expand=expansion(mult=0.03)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe portion of the regression line for Lovewell that extends below 0 was cut off in the published Figure 1. It is tempting to accomplish this by limiting the extent of the y-axis with limits= in scale_y_continuous() as has been done in other posts. However, in this case, that will remove the years for which the regression extends below zero from the data used to compute the regression, effectively altering the results. The better way to handle this is to limit the extent of the y-axis with ylim= in coord_cartesian(). With this all data is used in the regression, but the axis is clipped for viewing.\n\nggplot(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=yr,y=catch_m2)) +\n  geom_line(color=\"gray50\",linewidth=1) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",se=FALSE,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"black\",linewidth=1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(impd),ncol=1,scales=\"free_x\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Catch/m^2^\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0.02,0.10))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1995,2020),expand=expansion(mult=0.03)) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.4)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theme was then modified to try to match choices made by the authors. Specifically, the grid lines were removed; the x-axis title was removed; the axes tick mark labels were made slightly larger, bold, and black; and the facet strip labels were removed. In addition, the y-axis title was formatted with element_markdown() which forces any markdown language code in the title to be rendered appropriately. In this case, the “carets” around the “2” in name= (in scale_y_continuous()) is markup code to superscript the “2.” Other arguments to element_markdown() are treated the same as those in element_text(). Thus, the y-axis title was also made slightly larger and bold.\n\nggplot(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=yr,y=catch_m2)) +\n  geom_line(color=\"gray50\",linewidth=1) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",se=FALSE,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"black\",linewidth=1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(impd),ncol=1,scales=\"free_x\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Catch/m^2^\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0.02,0.10))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1995,2020),expand=expansion(mult=0.03)) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.4)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,face=\"bold\",color=\"black\"),\n        strip.text=element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y=element_markdown(size=12,face=\"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReservoir and Regression Result Labels\nThe last part to add to the plot is the reservoir label along with the significance (of the slope) and “r-squared” value from the regression. This takes a little bit of work.\nFirst, the regressions for each reservoir were fit “outside” of ggplot and the results returned from summary() were saved to individual objects.\n\nmreg <- summary(lm(catch_m2~yr,data=filter(dat,impd==\"Milford\")))\nlreg <- summary(lm(catch_m2~yr,data=filter(dat,impd==\"Lovewell\")))\n\nThese objects contain the pertinent p-value and r-squared, which will be extracted for use. The p-value is in the second row and Pr(>|t|) column of the $coefficients portion of the results. These values were extracted from both regression results, saved into a vector ps, and then that vector was given to p_format() from rstatix for formatting. This particular use of p_format() will include the p= or p< label, will use one significant digit, and will convert any p-value that is less than 0.001 to “p<0.001”.\n\n( ps <- c(mreg$coefficients[2,\"Pr(>|t|)\"],lreg$coefficients[2,\"Pr(>|t|)\"]) )\n\n#R|  [1] 7.148242e-03 3.053910e-08\n\n( ps <-rstatix::p_format(ps,add.p=TRUE,accuracy=0.001,digits=1) )\n\n#R|  [1] \"p=0.007\" \"p<0.001\"\n\n\nThe r-squared values are stored in $r.squared of the regression results and are extracted below and placed into a vector rs. They are then rounded to three decimal places and appended to r^2^ which is markdown language for r2.\n\n( rs <- c(mreg$r.squared,lreg$r.squared) )\n\n#R|  [1] 0.2971323 0.7588716\n\n( rs <- paste0(\"r^2^=\",round(rs,3)) )\n\n#R|  [1] \"r^2^=0.297\" \"r^2^=0.759\"\n\n\nFinally, a small data frame was created that had the reservoir names (in factor format to match the original data frame) and the ps and rs pasted together with <br> in between in a variable called lbls. The <br> will force a “line break” when the markdown language is rendered, thus forming a label with the r-squared value beneath to p-value result.\n\ndlbls <- data.frame(impd=factor(c(\"Milford\",\"Lovewell\"),levels=c(\"Milford\",\"Lovewell\")),\n                    lbls=paste0(ps,\"<br>\",rs))\ndlbls\n\n#R|        impd                  lbls\n#R|  1  Milford p=0.007<br>r^2^=0.297\n#R|  2 Lovewell p<0.001<br>r^2^=0.759\n\n\nThe reservoir names are added with geom_text() below as described in this post. Note here that size=13/.pt will use a 13 pt font and that fontface=\"bold\" will make the font bold. geom_richtext() is very similar to geom_text() except that it will render the markdown code appropriately. By default geom_richtext() places a box around the text, which is removed with label.color=NA. The reservoir label and the regression statistics were placed on the plot separately because the authors used a larger font for the reservoir label.\n\nggplot(data=dat,mapping=aes(x=yr,y=catch_m2)) +\n  geom_line(color=\"gray50\",linewidth=1) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",se=FALSE,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"black\",linewidth=1.2) +\n  geom_text(mapping=aes(label=impd),\n            x=2014,y=Inf,vjust=1.3,hjust=0,size=13/.pt,fontface=\"bold\",\n            check_overlap=TRUE) +\n  geom_richtext(data=dlbls,mapping=aes(label=lbls),\n                x=2014,y=Inf,vjust=1.5,hjust=0,size=10/.pt,fontface=\"bold\",\n                label.color=NA) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(impd),ncol=1,scales=\"free_x\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Catch/m^2^\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0.02,0.10))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1995,2020),expand=expansion(mult=0.03)) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.4)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,face=\"bold\",color=\"black\"),\n        strip.text=element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y=element_markdown(size=12,face=\"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFurther Thoughts\n\nConfidence Band\nIn the authors’ Figure 5 they included a confidence band around the fitted von Bertalanffy growth curve.

    "text": "Example 1 - Bar Chart\n\nSample Data\nSuppose you have very simple data where some numeric summary has been made for each group and that those groups are also categorized to a higher level. For example, total catch by species with species also categorized by family.11 Family is made a factor() here so that the order could be controlled (rather than alphabetical by default).\n\n\nCode\ndat1 <- data.frame(family=c(\"Centrarchid\",\"Centrarchid\",\"Percid\",\"Percid\",\"Esocid\"),\n                   species=c(\"Bluegill\",\"Pumpkinseed\",\"Walleye\",\"Sauger\",\"Muskellunge\"),\n                   catch=c(34,45,23,36,7)) |>\n  mutate(family=factor(family,levels=c(\"Centrarchid\",\"Percid\",\"Esocid\")))\ndat1\n\n\n#R|         family     species catch\n#R|  1 Centrarchid    Bluegill    34\n#R|  2 Centrarchid Pumpkinseed    45\n#R|  3      Percid     Walleye    23\n#R|  4      Percid      Sauger    36\n#R|  5      Esocid Muskellunge     7\n\n\nA simple bar chart of these data is created with geom_col() with species mapped to the x-axis and catch mapped to the y-axis. Here I provided a title for the y-axis, removed the lower expansion and reduce the upper expansion of the y-axis, applied the classic theme, increased the size of the axis title and tick mark text, made the axis titles bold, made the tick mark text black, and removed the x-axis title.\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the Twitter follower would want in this case is another layer of x-axis labels that would succinctly identify the family for each species.\n\n\nSpecifying Facets\nFaceting provides one option for applying these labels. Below I added one row of facets based on the family name with facet_grid().\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  facet_grid(cols=vars(family)) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis does not look immediately helpful!! However, adding scales=\"free_x\" to facet_grid() reduces each x-axis to only the species present in that facet (i.e., family).\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  facet_grid(cols=vars(family),scales=\"free_x\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding space=free_x to facet_grid() ensures that the “bars” in each facet are the same width by adjusting the facet width to match the space needed to show just the data for that facet.\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  facet_grid(cols=vars(family),scales=\"free_x\",space=\"free_x\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, adding switch=\"x\" to facet_grid() moves the facet strip labels to the bottom of the plot area for each facet.\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  facet_grid(cols=vars(family),scales=\"free_x\",space=\"free_x\",switch=\"x\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to move the facet strip labels “outside”2 the axis tick mark labels with strip.placement='outside' in theme(). The facet strip “box” was also removed with strip.background.x= and the facet strip text was altered with strip.text=.2 Rather than the default “inside”.\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  facet_grid(cols=vars(family),scales=\"free_x\",space=\"free_x\",switch=\"x\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"),\n        strip.placement='outside',\n        strip.background.x=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_text(size=12,color=\"black\",face=\"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, facets were “smushed” together so that the x-axis looks continuous by reducing panel.spacing.x= to 0.\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  facet_grid(cols=vars(family),scales=\"free_x\",space=\"free_x\",switch=\"x\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"),\n        strip.placement='outside',\n        strip.background.x=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_text(size=12,color=\"black\",face=\"bold\"),\n        panel.spacing.x=unit(0,\"pt\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe family categorization could be further highlighted with a fill= color mapped to family.\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch,fill=family)) +\n  geom_col(color=\"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  scale_fill_grey(start=0.1,end=0.5) +\n  facet_grid(cols=vars(family),scales=\"free_x\",space=\"free_x\",switch=\"x\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"),\n        strip.placement='outside',\n        strip.background.x=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_text(size=12,color=\"black\",face=\"bold\"),\n        panel.spacing.x=unit(0,\"pt\"),\n        legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Question\n\n\n\nI could not, using this method, figure out how to reduce the inter-facet gap between bars so that it matched the intra-facet gap between bars."

    "text": "Example 1 - Bar Chart\nA third options is to create space below the x-axis and “place” the secondary axis “manually.” Before creating this space it is important to order primary axis labels so that categories to be grouped by the secondary level are next to each other. In this example, the species variable must be converted to a factor with the levels controlled so that families are grouped together.\n\ndat1 <- dat1 |>\n  mutate(species=factor(species,levels=c(\"Bluegill\",\"Pumpkinseed\",\n                                         \"Walleye\",\"Sauger\",\n                                         \"Muskellunge\")))\n\nSpace below the x-axis is created by increasing the bottom margin around the plot with plot.margin= in theme(). Below the bottom margin was increased to two “lines” and the other margins were set to one “line”.44 The top, left, and right margins are defined by t=, l= and r= in margin().\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"),\n        plot.margin=margin(b=2,t=1,l=1,r=1,unit=\"lines\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot “clipping” must be turned off with clip=\"off\" in coord_caresian() to be able to place “objects” in the space just created.5 In addition, the y-axis limits should be set with ylim= in coord_cartesian() so that the y-axis limits do not change as labels are added beneath the x-axis. As a demonstration, I placed my name at the x=1.5 and y=-5 coordinate.5 Because that space is outside of the main plot area.\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"),\n        plot.margin=margin(b=2,t=1,l=1,r=1,unit=\"lines\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,NA),clip=\"off\") +\n  annotate(geom=\"text\",x=1.5,y=-5,label=\"Derek\",color=\"red\",fontface=\"bold\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a value for the y-coordinate beneath the axis is largely a matter of trial-and-error after an initial first guess. The x-coordinate, though, can largely be determined from the x-axis. The levels for a factor such as species are recorded as integers “behind-the-scenes.” In this example, a “Bluegill” is defined with a “1” as it is the first level and its bar will be above an invisible “1” on the x-axis. Thus, placing my name at x=1.5 centers it between the first and second bars.\nHere I want to create a secondary axis similar to what ggh4x produced – a line segment with a label underneath it. The first segment for the secondary axis should cover “Bluegill” and “Pumpkinseed.” Thus, it should start a little below 1 and end a little above 2. Other segments are defined similarly and stored in a data frame below.\n\nx2lns <- data.frame(xstart=c(0.55,2.55,4.55),\n                    xend=c(2.45,4.45,5.45))\nx2lns\n\n#R|    xstart xend\n#R|  1   0.55 2.45\n#R|  2   2.55 4.45\n#R|  3   4.55 5.45\n\n\nAt first, I roughly guess at starting and ending points and then come back to adjust these values if the lines need to be extended or shortened to look good. These segments are added to the plot with geom_segment() using this new data frame with the variables mapped appropriately. I set y= and yend= outside of aes() as the y-coordinate is constant for all these segments. Finally, the segment was made slightly heavier.\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"),\n        plot.margin=margin(b=2,t=1,l=1,r=1,unit=\"lines\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,NA),clip=\"off\") +\n  geom_segment(data=x2lns,mapping=aes(x=xstart,xend=xend),y=-5,yend=-5,\n               linewidth=0.75)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the segments are set as desired, another data frame is created that has the x-axis coordinate and text for the secondary axis label. Below, the coordinate was found by averaging xstart and xend for each segment in x2lns.6 The text for the labels was then entered manually.6 This x coordinates in this data frame could have been entered manually, but computing the average makes it easier to put the label in the center of the segment.\n\nx2lbls <- x2lns |>\n  rowwise() |>\n  summarize(x=mean(c(xstart,xend))) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  mutate(lbl=c(\"Centrarchid\",\"Percid\",\"Esocid\"))\nx2lbls\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#R|        x lbl        \n#R|    <dbl> <chr>      \n#R|  1   1.5 Centrarchid\n#R|  2   3.5 Percid     \n#R|  3   5   Esocid\n\n\nThese labels are then added with geom_text() using the new data frame with the variables mapped appropriately. Again, y= was set outside of aes() as this coordinate is constant for all labels. The text was adjusted to be a 12 pt bold.\n\nggplot(data=dat1,mapping=aes(x=species,y=catch)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.025))) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"),\n        plot.margin=margin(b=2,t=1,l=1,r=1,unit=\"lines\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,NA),clip=\"off\") +\n  geom_segment(data=x2lns,mapping=aes(x=xstart,xend=xend),y=-5,yend=-5,\n               linewidth=0.75) +\n  geom_text(data=x2lbls,mapping=aes(x=x,label=lbl),y=-8,\n            size=12/.pt,fontface=\"bold\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nChoosing how much to increase the bottom margin and choosing the x- and y-coordinates for the secondary x-axis labels with this method is largely a matter of trial-and-error."

The methods from above may be tried, but faceting clearly does not work (see below) and I could not get the ggh4x method to work with scale_x_date().\n\nggplot(data=dat2,mapping=aes(x=sample_date,y=catch)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth=1) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks=scales::breaks_width(\"month\"),\n               labels=scales::label_date(\"%b\"),expand=expansion(mult=0.01)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",limits=c(0,200),expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  facet_grid(cols=vars(yr),space='free_x',scales='free_x',switch='x') +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"),\n        strip.placement='outside',\n        strip.background.x=element_blank(),\n        strip.text=element_text(size=12,color=\"black\",face=\"bold\"),\n        panel.spacing.x=unit(0,\"pt\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 3, however, will work for situations like this. For this example, segments should “cover” Sep-Dec for 2021, Jan-Dec for 2022, and Jan-Mar for 2023. Starting (in xstart) and ending (in xend) dates for these segments are put in a data frame below. A data frame of labels is then constructed from it similar to before, except that the label is the year extracted from the x-coordinate date.\n\nx2lns <- data.frame(xstart=as.Date(c(\"20-Aug-2020\",\"20-Dec-2020\",\"20-Dec-2021\"),\n                                   format=\"%d-%B-%Y\"),\n                    xend=as.Date(c(\"15-Dec-2020\",\"15-Dec-2021\",\"15-Mar-2022\"),\n                                 format=\"%d-%B-%Y\"))\n\nx2lbls <- x2lns |>\n  rowwise() |>\n  summarize(x=mean(c(xstart,xend))) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  mutate(lbl=year(x))\n\nSegments and labels are then added as before.88 Note the use of coord_cartesian(), geom_segment(), geom_text(), and plot.margin=.\n\nggplot(data=dat2,mapping=aes(x=sample_date,y=catch)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth=1) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks=scales::breaks_width(\"month\"),\n               labels=scales::label_date(\"%b\"),expand=expansion(mult=0.01)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total catch\",expand=expansion(mult=0)) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,200),clip=\"off\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=12,face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=10,color=\"black\"),\n        plot.margin=margin(t=1,l=1,b=2,r=1,unit=\"lines\")) +\n  geom_segment(data=x2lns,mapping=aes(x=xstart,xend=xend),y=-18,yend=-18,\n               linewidth=0.75) +\n  geom_text(data=x2lbls,mapping=aes(x=x,label=lbl),y=-26,\n            size=12/.pt,fontface=\"bold\")"

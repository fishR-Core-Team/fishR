    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe following packages are loaded for use below.\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nA common graphic produced by many fisheries scientists is a length frequency histogram. As it turns out there are a few “tricks” to make a length frequency histogram appear as I expect most fisheries folks would want it to appear – primarily, left-inclusive (i.e., 100 would be in the 100-110 bin and not the 90-100 bin). In this post, I show how to construct a length frequency histograms with ggplot2 using my preferences.\nThe data are lengths of Lake Erie Walleye (Sander vitreus) captured during October-November, 2003-2014.1 My primary interest is in the tl (total length in mm), sex, and loc variables2 and I will focus on 2014 (as an example).\n\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nWE <- dplyr::filter(WalleyeErie2,year==2014)\n\n \n\n\nBasic Length Frequency\nMaking the histogram begins by identifying the data.frame to use in data= and the tl variable to use for the x-axis as an aes()thetic in ggplot(). The histogram is then constructed with geom_hist(), which I customize as follows:\n\nSet the width of the length bins with binwidth=.\nBy default the bins are centered on breaks created from binwidth=. The bins can be changed to begin on these breaks by using boundary=. The value that boundary=, which is set to the beginning of a first break, regardless of whether that break is in the data or not. I use boundary=0 so that bins will start on breaks that make sense relative to binwidth= (e.g., 0, 25, 50, 75, etc.).\nBins are left-exclusive and right-inclusive by default, but including closed=\"left\" will make the bins the desired left-inclusive and right-exclusive.\nThe fill color of the bins is set with fill= (I prefer a slight gray).\nThe outline color of the bins is set with color= (defaults to the same as fill=; I prefer a dark boundary to make the bins obvious).\n\nThe scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_continuous() are primarily used to provide labels (i.e., names) for the y- and x-axes, respectively. By default, the bins of the histogram will “hover” slightly above the x-axis, which I find annoying. The expand= in scale_y_continuous() is used to expand the lower limit of the y-axis by a multiple of 0 (thus, not expand the lower-limit) and expand the upper limit of the y-axis by a multiple of 0.05 (thus, the upper-limit will by 5% higher than the tallest bin so that the top frame of the plot will not touch the tallest bin). Finally, theme_bw() gives a classic “black-and-white” feel to the plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).\n\nlenfreq1 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 fill=\"gray80\",color=\"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\nNote that the resultant plot was assigned to an object. Thus, the object name must be run to see the plot.\n\nlenfreq1\n\n\n\n\nThis base object/plot can also be modified by adding (using +) to it as demonstrated later.\n \n\n\nBins Stacked by Another Variable\nIt may be useful to see the distribution of categories of fish (e.g., sex) within the length frequency bins. To do this, move the fill= in geom_histogram() to an aes()thetic in geom_histogram() and set it equal to the variable that will identify the separation within each bin (e.g., sex). The bins will be stacked by this variable if position=\"stacked\" in geom_histogram() (this is the default and would not need to be explicitly set below). The fill colors for each group can be set in a number of ways, but they are set manually below with scale_fill_manual().\n\nlenfreq2 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(fill=sex),binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 color=\"black\",position=\"stack\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"gray80\",\"gray40\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expand_scale(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\") +\n  theme_bw()\nlenfreq2\n\n\n\n\nStacked histograms are difficult to interpret in my opinion. In a future post, I will show how to use empirical density functions to examine distributions among categories.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. I also set the default ggplot theme to theme_bw() for a classic “black-and-white” plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nA common graphic produced by many fisheries scientists is a length frequency histogram. As it turns out there are a few “tricks” to make a length frequency histogram appear as I expect most fisheries folks would want it to appear – primarily, left-inclusive (i.e., 100 would be in the 100-110 bin and not the 90-100 bin). In this post, I show how to construct a length frequency histograms with ggplot2 using my preferences.\nThe data are lengths of Lake Erie Walleye (Sander vitreus) captured during October-November, 2003-2014.1 My primary interest is in the tl (total length in mm), sex, and loc variables2 and I will focus on 2014 (as an example).\n\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nWE <- dplyr::filter(WalleyeErie2,year==2014)\n\n \n\n\nBasic Length Frequency\nMaking the histogram (Figure 1) begins by identifying the data frame to use in data= and the tl variable to use for the x-axis as an aes()thetic in ggplot(). The histogram is then constructed with geom_hist(), which I customize as follows:\n\nSet the width of the length bins with binwidth=.\nBy default the bins are centered on breaks created from binwidth=. The bins can be changed to begin on these breaks by using boundary= set to the desired value of a first break, regardless of whether that break is in the data or not. I use boundary=0 so that bins will start on breaks that make sense relative to binwidth= (e.g., 0, 25, 50, 75, etc.).\nBins are left-exclusive and right-inclusive by default. Use closed=\"left\" to make the bins the desired left-inclusive and right-exclusive.\nThe fill color of the bins is set with fill= (I prefer a slight gray).\nThe outline color of the bins is set with color= (defaults to the same as fill=; I prefer a dark boundary to make the bins obvious).\n\nThe scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_continuous() are primarily used to provide labels (i.e., names) for the y- and x-axes, respectively. By default, the bins of the histogram will “hover” slightly above the x-axis, which I find annoying. The expand= in scale_y_continuous() is used to expand the lower limit of the y-axis by a multiple of 0 (thus, not expand the lower-limit) and expand the upper limit of the y-axis by a multiple of 0.05 (thus, the upper-limit will by 5% higher than the tallest bin so that the top frame of the plot will not touch the tallest bin).3\n\nlenfreq1 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 fill=\"gray80\",color=\"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\")\nlenfreq1\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Length frequency of histogram of Lake Erie Walleye, 2014.\n\n\n\n\nThis base object/plot can be modified by adding (using +) to it as demonstrated later.\n \n\n\nStacked by Other Variable\nIt may be useful to see the distribution of categories of fish (e.g., sex) within the length frequency bins (Figure 2). To do this, add fill= in the aes()thetic in ggplot() and set it equal to the variable that identifies the separation within each bin (e.g., sex). The bins will be stacked by this variable if position=\"stack\" in geom_histogram().4 The fill colors for each group can be set in a number of ways, but they are set manually below with scale_fill_manual().\n\nlenfreq2 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl,fill=sex)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 color=\"black\",position=\"stack\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"gray80\",\"gray40\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\")\nlenfreq2\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 stacked by sex.\n\n\n\n\nStacked histograms are difficult to interpret in my opinion. In a future post, I will show how to use empirical density functions to examine distributions among categories. For the time being, see below.\n \n\n\nSeparated by Other Variable(s)\nA strength of ggplot2 is that it can easily make the same plot for several different levels of another variable; e.g., separate length frequency histograms by sex (Figure 3). The plot (e.g., lenfreq from above) can be separated into different “facets” with facet_wrap(), which takes the variable to separate by within vars() as the first argument.\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_wrap(vars(sex))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex.\n\n\n\n\nIf the faceted groups have very different sample sizes then it may be useful to use a potentially different y-axis scale for each facet by including scales=\"free_y\" in facet_wrap() (Figure 4). Similarly, a potentially different scale can be used for each x-axis with scales=\"free_x\" or for both axes with scales=\"free\".\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_wrap(vars(sex),scales=\"free_y\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex with different frequency scales.\n\n\n\n\nPlots may be faceted over multiple variables with facet_grid() (Figure 5), where the variables that identify the rows and variables for a grid of facets are included (within vars()) in rows= and cols=, respectively. Both scales can not be “free” with facet_grid(), the scale can only be “free” within a row or column.\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_grid(rows=vars(loc),cols=vars(sex),scales=\"free_y\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex and location of capture with different frequency scales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThese data are available in the FSAdata package and formed many of the examples in Chapter 12 of the Age and Growth of Fishes: Principles and Techniques book.↩︎\nSee here for more details↩︎\nThe resultant plot was assigned to an object so that name must be typed and run to see the plot.↩︎\nThis is the default and would not need to be explicitly set below).↩︎\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{h.ogle2019,\n  author = {Derek H.

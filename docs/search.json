In particular, this user wanted to identify each fish for which the individual CV values from comparing two independent age estimates was greater than 10. This is fairly easy to do with an understanding of the results returned from agePrecision(). Below is an example using the WhitefishLC data found in the FSA package.11 These data are automatically loaded with library(FSA).\nThese data contain, among other things, ages assigned by two readers examining otoliths in (otolith1 and otolith2).22 headtail() from FSA shows the first and last three rows of a data frame.

    "text": "Ogle (2017) described an algorithm for implementing the “seasonal cessation in growth model” of Pauly et al. (1992). Describing an algorithm for a growth model does not seem like a useful contribution to the literature, as fitting growth models is pretty standard fare for fisheries scientists. However, fitting the Pauly et al. (1992) model is complicated by the fact that the age data is modified by model parameters. This too may not seem particularly interesting given that \\(t_0\\) in the typical von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) also modifies the age variable (i.e., age-\\(t_0\\) appears in the VBGF equation). However, the modification of age in the Pauly et al. (1992) model is a shift AND a compression of the age variable, AND the degree of shift and compression is a function of age. This is different, and more complicated, than the simple shift along the age axis in the typical VBGF.\nAs I demonstrate in my note, the Pauly et al. (1992) model has, for all practical purposes, not been used in the fisheries literature. I believe this lack of use is largely attributable to lack of clarity in how to implement the model in computer code.1 My hope is that the algorithm in my note will clarify the implementation of this model. Fisheries scientists can then rigorously test whether this model provides any advantage over other growth models with a seasonal component.1 Pauly et al. (1992) did provide a brief description of their model, but not a detailed description of how the age variable was adjusted, and computer software for fitting their model, though that software, and its source code, have long been lost.\nFull R code implementin the algorithm is available here. Implementation of the algorithm depends on the FSA package, which is available on CRAN. Please let me know what you think.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nExample fitting of the Pauly et al.

This phenomenon is briefly illustrated below.\n \n\n\nOne Age\n\nCreate an R function for the typical von Bertalanffy growth function.\n\n\nvb <- FSA::vbFuns()\n\n\nDeclare parameter values.\n\n\nLinf <- 30\nK <- 0.3\nt0 <- -0.5\n\n\nPredict mean length at some initial age.\n\n\ninitA <- 1\n( initL <- vb(initA,Linf,K,t0) )\n\n#R|  [1] 10.87116\n\n\n\nPredict mean length at the initial age plus \\(\\frac{log_{e}(2)}{K}\\).\n\n\nnextA <- initA+log(2)/K\n( nextL <- vb(nextA,Linf,K,t0) )\n\n#R|  [1] 20.43558\n\n\n\nFind the length that is halfway between the initial length and \\(L_{\\infty}\\).1\n\n1 all.equal() is used to test equality with a tolerance for machine precision.\n( hwL <- mean(c(initL,Linf)) )\n\n#R|  [1] 20.43558\n\nall.equal(nextL,hwL)\n\n#R|  [1] TRUE\n\n\nNote that these last two values are equal, which illustrates the statement above about the “half-life” meaning of \\(K\\).\n \nThis can be repeated for a different initial age.\n\ninitA <- 7\n( initL <- vb(initA,Linf,K,t0) )\n\n#R|  [1] 26.83802\n\nnextA <- initA+log(2)/K\n( nextL <- vb(nextA,Linf,K,t0) )\n\n#R|  [1] 28.41901\n\n( hwL <- mean(c(initL,Linf)) )\n\n#R|  [1] 28.41901\n\nall.equal(nextL,hwL)\n\n#R|  [1] TRUE\n\n\n \nThe two examples above can be examined in Figure 1, where the horizontal green lines illustrate the increase from the initial ages (e.g., 1 and 7) by \\(\\frac{log_{e}(2)}{K}\\), the vertical red line is the change in length from the initial length to half of \\(L_{\\infty}\\), and the vertical orange line is the remaining change in length to \\(L_{\\infty}\\). The half-life property of \\(K\\) is thus illustrated by the equivalent lengths of the paired red and orange lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Demonstration of the half-life property of the K parameter in the von Bertalanffy growth function.

For example, we published a paper that examined (among other things) the lengths of Kiyi (Coregonus kiyi) captured in trawl tows in Lake Superior from 2003 to 2014.

A weight-length relationship was available (derived from a smaller sample from the same population). A question arose about whether the weight-length relationship should be used to predict weights for individual fish and then summarized to estimate mean weights at age or whether the weight-length relationship should be applied to summarized mean lengths-at-age to estimate mean weights-at-age.\nThis issue has been addressed in the literature. Ricker (1975) states that the true mean weight is always greater, “on the order of 5%,” than the mean weight computed from the weight-length relationship with the mean length. Tesch (1971) suggested that the error in predicting mean weight-at-age with the weight-length relationship using mean length-at-age would be about 5-10%. In a simulation study, Nielsen and Schoch (1980) found that Tesch’s suggestion was too general and that error was less than 10% when the coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation divided by mean) in lengths was less than 10%, but could be substantially higher when the CV was higher, with the specific result dependent on the weight-length regression exponent (b).1 Pienaar and Ricker (1968) and Beyer (1991) both suggested corrections to reduce the bias in the mean weight-at-age produced by the weight-length regression using the mean length.1 Nielsen and Schoch (1980) provided a nice geometric description of why this bias occurs.\nIn this post, I explore the bias in using the weight-length regression to estimate mean weight-at-age from mean length-at-age and the correction factors suggested by Beyer (1991).\n \n\n\nSample Data\nI created a very simple population that consisted of lengths, weights, and ages of fish. Ages were derived from a population with roughly a 30% annual mortality rate. Mean lengths-at-age were modeled with a von Bertalanffy growth curve using a \\(L_{\\infty}\\)=650 mm, \\(K\\)=0.3, and \\(t_{0}\\)=0. Individual lengths were modeled from normal distributions using the modeled mean length and a constant standard deviation of 30 mm) within each age-class. Weights were predicted directly from a known weight-length relationship without any error (in wt1) and with a small amount of error (in wt2).\n\n# Generate some lengths\nages <- 3:8\nN3 <- 100      ## number at age-3\nA <- 0.3       ## annual morality rate\nns <- round(N3*(1-A)^(ages-min(ages)),0)  ## numbers at age\nLinf <- 650    ## von B parameters\nK <- 0.3\nt0 <- 0\nmns <- Linf*(1-exp(-K*(ages-t0)))         ## mean length-at-age\nsds <- rep(30,length(mns))\nlens <- NULL\nfor (i in 1:length(ages))                 ## individual lengths-at-age\n  lens <- c(lens,rnorm(ns[i],mean=mns[i],sd=sds[i]))\nloga <- -13.5  ## weight-length relationship parameters\nb <- 3.2\n# Compute weights from the W-L relationship, w/ & w/o error\ndf <- data.frame(age=rep(ages,ns),len=round(lens,0)) |>\n  mutate(wt1=round(exp(loga+b*log(len)),0),\n         wt2=round(exp(loga+b*log(len)+rnorm(length(lens),mean=0,sd=0.1)),0))\nheadtail(df)\n\n#R|      age len  wt1  wt2\n#R|  1     3 374  235  197\n#R|  2     3 401  293  313\n#R|  3     3 369  225  210\n#R|  292   8 580  955  923\n#R|  293   8 605 1093 1081\n#R|  294   8 589 1003 1126\n\n\nModeling data in this way is simple, but at least somewhat realistic (Figure 1).\n\nlenh <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=len)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=10,boundary=0,color=\"black\",fill=\"gray70\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Length (mm)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"frequency\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05)))\nlenw <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=wt2)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,color=\"black\",fill=\"gray70\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Weight (g)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"frequency\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05)))\nwl <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=len,y=wt2)) +\n  geom_point(pch=21,fill=\"gray70\",color=\"black\")  +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Length (mm)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Weight (g)\")\nal <- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=age,y=len)) +\n  geom_jitter(pch=21,fill=\"gray70\",color=\"black\",width=0.05,height=0)  +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Length (mm)\")\n(lenh + lenw) / (wl + al)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Histograms of lengths (upper left) and weights (upper right) and scatterplots of weight versus length (lower left) and length versus age (lower right).\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExplore the Bias\nBelow the mean length (mnlen) and mean weight without any random erro (i.e., the “true” mean weight for individuals modeled above; true.mnwt) are calculated (using group_by() and summarize()). The predicted mean weight at each age is then computed from the mean length at each age and the weight-length relationship (i.e., pr.mnwt using mutate() and the regression coefficient values from above). Finally a percentage error between the predicted and true mean weights is computed for each age (in dif.minwt).22 The as.data.frame() is used here because I don’t like the tibble format that is returned by summarize().\n\nsum1 <- group_by(df,age) |>\n  summarize(mnlen=mean(len),\n            true.mnwt=mean(wt1)) |>\n  mutate(pr.mnwt=exp(loga+b*log(mnlen)),\n         dif.mnwt=(pr.mnwt-true.mnwt)/true.mnwt*100) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\nThe results from this one sample show that the mean weights computed from the mean lengths and the weight-length regression (i.e., pr.mnwt) are lower at each age then the “true” mean weights (true.mnwt; Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage\nmnlen\ntrue.mnwt\npr.mnwt\ndif.mnwt\n\n\n\n\n3\n391\n276\n270\n-2.15\n\n\n4\n454\n448\n438\n-2.23\n\n\n5\n511\n644\n636\n-1.29\n\n\n6\n550\n817\n806\n-1.35\n\n\n7\n570\n912\n906\n-0.72\n\n\n8\n594\n1034\n1028\n-0.58\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary table using weights without any error and no correction for the predicted mean weights.\n\n\n \nOf course, weight-length relationships are not without error, so the weights with a small amount of random error were used to determine if the pattern of a negative bias when predicting mean weights from mean lengths persists with more realistic data.3 Results from this one set of more realistic data showed a similar, though not as consistent, degree of negative bias when predicting mean weights from mean lengths (Table 2).3 Only a small error was added because the relationship between weight and length is very strong for most fishes. The r-squared for this relationship was a realistic 0.969.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage\nmnlen\ntrue.mnwt\npr.mnwt\ndif.mnwt\n\n\n\n\n3\n391\n277\n270\n-2.55\n\n\n4\n454\n448\n438\n-2.24\n\n\n5\n511\n643\n636\n-1.12\n\n\n6\n550\n830\n806\n-2.87\n\n\n7\n570\n906\n906\n-0.02\n\n\n8\n594\n1054\n1028\n-2.50\n\n\n\nTable 2: Summary table using weights with a small amount of error and no correction for the predicted mean weights.\n\n\n \nI then performed the analysis above 1000 times, keeping track of the percent error between the predicted weight and the true mean weight for each age for each sample.44 The code here also uses the correction factors discussed above; those results are presented further below.\n\n\n\nThe results of this simulation suggest an average negative bias near 4% for age-3 fish and between about 1 and 2% for all older fish (Table 3). Note that the CV in length for each age varied between 2.7% and 9.8% in these simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage3\nage4\nage5\nage6\nage7\nage8\n\n\n\n\n-2.49\n-1.97\n-1.74\n-1.5\n-1.32\n-1.39\n\n\n\nTable 3: Mean percentage difference in uncorrected predicted mean and true mean weights by age class for 1000 simulations.\n\n\n \nSimilar patterns were found using different values of the weight-length relationship exponent \\(b\\) (see Appendix). However, larger negative biases were observed as the standard deviation in lengths increased (see Appendix).\n\n\nA Possible Correction\nAs noted above, Pienaar and Ricker (1968) and Beyer (1991) offered methods to reduce or eliminate the bias from using the weight-length regression to estimate mean weight-at-age from mean length-at-age. Beyer’s corrections were simple as they were based on the CV of lengths and the \\(b\\) coefficient from the weight-length regression. Beyer specifically offered three possible bias correcting factors for isometric growth, allometric growth assuming a lognormal distribution, and allometric growth assuming a normal distributions for lengths. Here I will only consider Beyer’s corrections for allometric growth with lognormal (i.e, Beyer’s equation 16) and normal (i.e., Beyer’s equation 18) distributions of lengths within age classes.\nBeyer’s formulae are implemented by modifying group_by() and summarize() used previously. Specifically the standard deviation of lengths is calculated (in sdlen) so that the CV of lengths can be calculated (in cvlen).

These results suggest that the mean bias in predicted weights at age when corrected with a correction factor appear to only be on the order of a quarter to a half a percent. These corrections seems to perform fairly consistently across a few different values of the weight-length regression exponent \\(b\\) and standard deviations in lengths (see Appendix).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nage3\nage4\nage5\nage6\nage7\nage8\n\n\n\n\nNo correction\n-2.49\n-1.97\n-1.74\n-1.50\n-1.32\n-1.39\n\n\nNormal (eqn 18)\n-0.43\n-0.45\n-0.52\n-0.45\n-0.35\n-0.49\n\n\nLognormal (eqn 16)\n-0.41\n-0.45\n-0.51\n-0.44\n-0.35\n-0.48\n\n\n\nTable 4: Mean percentage difference in two types of corrected predicted mean and true mean weights by age class for 1000 simulations.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhy Worry About This?\nWhy am I worried about this if the bias is on the order of 4% or less? First, for my application, we are estimating mean weight so that we can expand to total biomass. While a 4% error on an individual fish may seem inconsequential, that error can become quite important when expanded to represent total biomass, especially when it is a consistent negative bias.\nSo, why worry about correction factors when I can easily predict the weight for individual fish with the weight-length regression and then summarize these fish to get mean weight at age? In my situation, it appears that some of our mean lengths at age, and by extension mean weights at age, are poorly estimated because of small sample sizes at some ages. I am considering fitting a growth model (e.g., von Bertalanffy growth model) to the length-at-age data such that the fitted model can be used to predict mean lengths at age. The advantage of this is that information at other ages can be used to inform the calculation of mean length at an age. [The potential downside, of course, is that I would be prescribing a smooth curve to the growth trajectory.] If I can then estimate mean weights at age with minimal bias from the mean lengths at age from the growth model, then this could (I would need to test this) be beneficial in my situation.\n \n\n\nSummary\nMean weights at age appear to be estimated with bias when a weight-length relationship is applied to mean lengths at age without any correction factor. The correction factors suggested by Beyer (1991) are easy to implement and seem to reduce the bias in predicted mean weights-at-age to near negligible levels. Thus, if mean weights at age cannot be predicted from individual fish, then it may be possible to get reasonable estimates from the weight-length relationship and mean lengths at age.\n \n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBeyer, J.

The plyr package is also used but it is not loaded because I am only going to use one specific function from plyr (i.e., mapvalues()).]\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)   # for mutate(), case_when()\nlibrary(forcats) # for fct_recode(), fct_collapse()\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nI have received a few queries recently that can be categorized as “How do I collapse a list of categories or values into a shorter list of categories or values?” For example, one user wanted to collapse species of fish into their respective families. Another user wanted to collapse years into decades. Data wrangling such as this is common in fisheries and is briefly described below.\n \n\n\nSample Data\nThe following creates a very simple sample of 250 individuals on which the species (as a short abbreviation) and year of capture were recorded. Because I am creating random example data below, I set the random number seed to make the results reproducible.\n\nset.seed(678394)  # for reproducibility of random data\nn <- 250          # to allow easily changing sample size\ndat <- data.frame(species=sample(c(\"BLG\",\"LMB\",\"PKS\",\"WAE\",\"YEP\",\"CRP\"),\n                                 n,replace=TRUE),\n                  year=sample(1980:2017,n,replace=TRUE))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year\n#R> 1     YEP 1996\n#R> 2     PKS 2005\n#R> 3     PKS 2013\n#R> 4     YEP 2014\n#R> 5     CRP 2016\n#R> 6     PKS 2006\n\n\n \n\n\nRecode Categories\nThis example demonstrates how to change the codes in one variable (e.g., species abbreviations) to new codes in another variable (e.g., long species names).\nBefore recoding I find it easier to create a vector that contains the original codes to convert from. For example, unique() extracts the vector of species abbreviations found in the species variable of the example data, which I then saved in short and alphabetized to make the next steps easier.\n\nshort <- unique(dat$species) |>\n  sort()\nshort\n\n#R> [1] \"BLG\" \"CRP\" \"LMB\" \"PKS\" \"WAE\" \"YEP\"\n\n\nIn addition, I also create a vector of codes that these codes will be converted to. For example, the long vector below contains the long-form names for each species (in the same order as the abbreviations in short)\n\nlong <- c(\"Bluegill\",\"Carp\",\"Largemouth Bass\",\n          \"Pumpkinseed\",\"Walleye\",\"Yellow Perch\")\n\nYou should “column-bind” these two vectors together to ensure that the codes align.\n\ncbind(short,long)\n\n#R>      short long             \n#R> [1,] \"BLG\" \"Bluegill\"       \n#R> [2,] \"CRP\" \"Carp\"           \n#R> [3,] \"LMB\" \"Largemouth Bass\"\n#R> [4,] \"PKS\" \"Pumpkinseed\"    \n#R> [5,] \"WAE\" \"Walleye\"        \n#R> [6,] \"YEP\" \"Yellow Perch\"\n\n\nThe mapvalues() function (from plyr) may be used to efficiently recode character (or factor) values.1 Because mapvalues() operates on a vector, it should be used within mutate() (from dplyr) to add a new variable with the recoded values to a data frame. Within mutate() the first argument to mapvalues() is the variable that contains the original data to be recoded. A vector of categories to code from is given in from= and a vector of new categories to code to is given in to=. For example, the combined use of mutate() and mapvalues() below demonstrates creating a new variable in the data frame with the long species names.1 The use of plyr:: in front of mapvalues() ensures that mapvalues() from plyr and not another package will be used and allows for not loading the entire plyr package.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(speciesL=plyr::mapvalues(species,from=short,to=long))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\nThis use of mapvalues() and mutate() is described in Section 2.2.7 of my book Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R.\n\n\n \nThe fct_recode() function (from forcats) can also be used to recode categories. Within mutate() the first argument to fct_recode() is the original factor variable. Subsequent arguments are of the form new level name equal to old level name.2 For example, the same recoding to long species name is shown below.2 Any levels not listed in fct_recode() will be retained with their original names.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(speciesL2=fct_recode(species,\n                              \"Bluegill\" = \"BLG\",\n                              \"Carp\" = \"CRP\",\n                              \"Largemouth Bass\" = \"LMB\",\n                              \"Pumpkinseed\" = \"PKS\",\n                              \"Walleye\" = \"WAE\",\n                              \"Yellow Perch\" = \"YEP\"))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL    speciesL2\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed\n\n\n \n\n\nCollapse Categories\nIn some instances, one may want to collapse some categories into a single category (e.g., species into a family). This is easily accomplished with mapvalues() or fct_recode() by simply repeating some of the “to” categories. For example, family contains family names that correspond to the species names in the data frame. Note how multiple species have the same family name category.\n\nfam <- c(\"Centrarchidae\",\"Cyprinidae\",\"Centrarchidae\",\n         \"Centrarchidae\",\"Percidae\",\"Percidae\")\ncbind(short,long,fam)\n\n#R>      short long              fam            \n#R> [1,] \"BLG\" \"Bluegill\"        \"Centrarchidae\"\n#R> [2,] \"CRP\" \"Carp\"            \"Cyprinidae\"   \n#R> [3,] \"LMB\" \"Largemouth Bass\" \"Centrarchidae\"\n#R> [4,] \"PKS\" \"Pumpkinseed\"     \"Centrarchidae\"\n#R> [5,] \"WAE\" \"Walleye\"         \"Percidae\"     \n#R> [6,] \"YEP\" \"Yellow Perch\"    \"Percidae\"\n\n\nThe example below shows how to convert the species name abbreviations to family names. In addition, the last use of mapvalues() shows how to change the long-form names to family names. This last example is, of course, repetitive, but it is used here to demonstrate how mutate() allows a variable that was “just created” to be immediately used.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(family=plyr::mapvalues(species,from=short,to=fam),\n         family2=plyr::mapvalues(speciesL,from=long,to=fam))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n\n\nThe “collapsing” of multiple levels into one level can also be accomplished with fct_collapse() (from forcats). The first argument to this function is again the variable containing the “old” levels. Subsequent arguments are formed by setting a new level name equal to a vector containing old level names to collapse.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(family3=fct_collapse(species,\n                              \"Centarchidae\" = c(\"BLG\",\"PKS\",\"LMB\"),\n                              \"Percidae\" = c(\"WAE\",\"YEP\"),\n                              \"Cyprinidae\" = c(\"CRP\")))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R>        family3\n#R> 1     Percidae\n#R> 2 Centarchidae\n#R> 3 Centarchidae\n#R> 4     Percidae\n#R> 5   Cyprinidae\n#R> 6 Centarchidae\n\n\n \n\n\nCollapse Values into Categories\nIt is also common to categorize a numeric variable. For example, a “decade” variable is derived from the year variable in this example.\nThe case_when() function (from dplyr) may be used to efficiently collapse discrete values into categories. This function also operates on vectors and, thus, must be used with mutate() to add a variable to a data frame. The arguments to case_when() are a series of two-sided formulae where the left-side is a conditioning statement based on the original data and the right-side is the value that should appear in the new variable when that condition is TRUE. For example, the first line in case_when() below asks “if the year variable is in the values from 1980 to 1989 then the new category should be ‘1980s’.”3 For example, the code below creates a new variable called decade that identifies the decade that corresponds to the year-of-capture variable.3 The colon operator creates a sequence of all integers between the two numbers separated by the colon. The %in% is used on conditional statements to determine if a value is contained within a vector, returning TRUE if it is and FALSE if it is not.\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(decade=case_when(\n    year %in% 1980:1989 ~ \"1980s\",\n    year %in% 1990:1999 ~ \"1990s\",\n    year %in% 2000:2009 ~ \"2000s\",\n    year %in% 2010:2019 ~ \"2010s\"\n  ))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R>        family3 decade\n#R> 1     Percidae  1990s\n#R> 2 Centarchidae  2000s\n#R> 3 Centarchidae  2010s\n#R> 4     Percidae  2010s\n#R> 5   Cyprinidae  2010s\n#R> 6 Centarchidae  2000s\n\n\nThe lines in case_when() operate sequentially (like a series of “if” statements) such that the above operation can be more succinctly coded as below. Also note in this example that the resulting variable is numeric rather than categorical (simply as an example).\n\ndat <- dat |>\n  mutate(decade2=case_when(\n    year <= 1989 ~ 1980,\n    year <= 1999 ~ 1990,\n    year <= 2009 ~ 2000,\n    year <= 2019 ~ 2010,\n  ))\nhead(dat)\n\n#R>   species year     speciesL    speciesL2        family       family2\n#R> 1     YEP 1996 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 2     PKS 2005  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 3     PKS 2013  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R> 4     YEP 2014 Yellow Perch Yellow Perch      Percidae      Percidae\n#R> 5     CRP 2016         Carp         Carp    Cyprinidae    Cyprinidae\n#R> 6     PKS 2006  Pumpkinseed  Pumpkinseed Centrarchidae Centrarchidae\n#R>        family3 decade decade2\n#R> 1     Percidae  1990s    1990\n#R> 2 Centarchidae  2000s    2000\n#R> 3 Centarchidae  2010s    2010\n#R> 4     Percidae  2010s    2010\n#R> 5   Cyprinidae  2010s    2010\n#R> 6 Centarchidae  2000s    2000\n\nstr(dat)\n\n#R> 'data.frame':   250 obs. of  9 variables:\n#R>  $ species  : chr  \"YEP\" \"PKS\" \"PKS\" \"YEP\" ...\n#R>  $ year     : int  1996 2005 2013 2014 2016 2006 2002 2012 2013 2014 ...\n#R>  $ speciesL : chr  \"Yellow Perch\" \"Pumpkinseed\" \"Pumpkinseed\" \"Yellow Perch\" ...\n#R>  $ speciesL2: Factor w/ 6 levels \"Bluegill\",\"Carp\",..: 6 4 4 6 2 4 5 1 3 6 ...\n#R>  $ family   : chr  \"Percidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Percidae\" ...\n#R>  $ family2  : chr  \"Percidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Centrarchidae\" \"Percidae\" ...\n#R>  $ family3  : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Centarchidae\",..: 3 1 1 3 2 1 3 1 1 3 ...\n#R>  $ decade   : chr  \"1990s\" \"2000s\" \"2010s\" \"2010s\" ...\n#R>  $ decade2  : num  1990 2000 2010 2010 2010 2000 2000 2010 2010 2010 ...\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou may be motivated from this example to use case_when() to develop a length category variable from measure lengths. While this is possible it is not efficient as you would have several conditions within case_when() (to span all measured lengths) and you would need to make sure that your conditions covered the range of measured lengths.

A common “learning opportunity” occurs when students are asked to compute the mean catch (or CPE), along with a standard deviation (SD), across multiple gear sets for each species. The learning opportunity occurs because some species will invariably not be caught in some gear sets. When the students summarize the number of fish caught for each species in each gear set those species not caught in a particular gear set will not “appear” in their data. Thus, when calculating the mean, the student will get the correct numerator (sum of catch across all gear sets) but not denominator (they use number of catches summed rather than total number of gear sets), which inflates (over-estimates) the mean catch and (usually) deflates (under-estimates) the SD of catches. Once confronted with this issue, they easily realize how to correct the mean calculation, but calculating the standard deviation is still an issue. These problems are exacerbated when using software to compute these summary statistics across many individual gear sets.\nIn software, the “trick” is to add a zero for each species not caught in a specific gear set that was caught in at least one gear set. For example, if Bluegill were caught in at least one gear set but not in the third gear set, then a zero must be added as the catch of Bluegill in the third gear set. The addZeroCatch() function in the FSA package was an attempt to efficiently add these zeroes. This function has proven useful over the years, but I have become dissatisfied with its clunkiness. Additionally, I recently became aware of the complete() function in the tidyr package which holds promise for handling the same task. In this post, I explore the use of complete() for handling this issue.\n \n\n\nSimple Data\nIn this first example, the data consists of species and length recorded for each captured fish organized by the gear set identification number (ID) and held in the fishdat data.frame.\n\n\n#R|    ID species  tl\n#R|  1  1     BLG 148\n#R|  2  1     BLG 153\n#R|  3  1     BLG 147\n#R|  4  1     BLG 149\n#R|  5  1     BLG 144\n#R|  6  1     BLG 145\n\n\nThe catch of each species in each gear set may be found using group_by() and summarize() with n().11  I find the tibble structure returned by group_by() to be annoying with simple data frames like this. Thus, I usually use as.data.frame() to remove it.\n\ncatch <- fishdat |>\n  group_by(ID,species) |>\n  summarize(num=n()) |>\n  as.data.frame()\ncatch\n\n#R|     ID species num\n#R|  1   1     BLG  10\n#R|  2   1     LMB   5\n#R|  3   1     YEP   5\n#R|  4   2     LMB   9\n#R|  5   2     YEP   7\n#R|  6   3     BLG  12\n#R|  7   3     YEP   7\n#R|  8   4     BLG   1\n#R|  9   4     LMB  11\n#R|  10  4     YEP  11\n#R|  11  5     BLG   9\n\n\nFrom this it is seen that three species (“BLG”, “LMB”, and “YEP”) were captured across all nets, but that “BLG” were not captured in “ID=2”, “LMB” were not captured in “ID=3”, and “LMB” and “YEP” were not captured in “ID=5”. The sample size, mean, and SD of catches per species from these data may be found by again using group_by() and summarize(). However, these calculations are INCORRECT because they do not include the zero catches of “BLG” in “ID=2”, “LMB” in “ID=3”, and “LMB” and “YEP” in “ID=5”. The problem is most evident in the sample sizes, which should be five (gear sets) for each species.\n\n## Example of INCORRECT summaries because not using zeroes\ncatch |> \n  group_by(species) |>\n  summarize(n=n(),mn=mean(num),sd=sd(num)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\n#R|    species n       mn       sd\n#R|  1     BLG 4 8.000000 4.830459\n#R|  2     LMB 3 8.333333 3.055050\n#R|  3     YEP 4 7.500000 2.516611\n\n\nThe complete() function can be used to add rows to a data frame for variables (or combinations of variables) that should be present in the data frame (relative to other values that are present) but are not. The complete() function takes a data frame as its first argument (but will be “piped” in below with |>) and the variable or variables that will be used to identify which items are missing. For example, with these data, a zero should be added to num for missing combinations defined by ID and species.\n\n## Example of default complete ... see below to add zeroes, not NAs\ncatch |>\n  complete(ID,species) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\n#R|     ID species num\n#R|  1   1     BLG  10\n#R|  2   1     LMB   5\n#R|  3   1     YEP   5\n#R|  4   2     BLG  NA\n#R|  5   2     LMB   9\n#R|  6   2     YEP   7\n#R|  7   3     BLG  12\n#R|  8   3     LMB  NA\n#R|  9   3     YEP   7\n#R|  10  4     BLG   1\n#R|  11  4     LMB  11\n#R|  12  4     YEP  11\n#R|  13  5     BLG   9\n#R|  14  5     LMB  NA\n#R|  15  5     YEP  NA\n\n\nFrom this result, it is seen that complete() added a row for “BLG” in “ID=2”, “LMB” in “ID=3”, and “LMB” and “YEP” in “ID=5” as we had hoped. However, complete() adds NAs by default. The value to add can be changed with fill=, which takes a list that includes the name of the variable to which the NAs were added (num in this case) set equal to the value to be added (0 in this case).22 Here the result is saved into the catch data frame, thus modifying the original data frame with the addition of the zeroes.\n\ncatch <- catch |>\n  complete(ID,species,fill=list(num=0)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\ncatch\n\n#R|     ID species num\n#R|  1   1     BLG  10\n#R|  2   1     LMB   5\n#R|  3   1     YEP   5\n#R|  4   2     BLG   0\n#R|  5   2     LMB   9\n#R|  6   2     YEP   7\n#R|  7   3     BLG  12\n#R|  8   3     LMB   0\n#R|  9   3     YEP   7\n#R|  10  4     BLG   1\n#R|  11  4     LMB  11\n#R|  12  4     YEP  11\n#R|  13  5     BLG   9\n#R|  14  5     LMB   0\n#R|  15  5     YEP   0\n\n\nThese correct catch data can then be summarized as above to show the correct sample size, mean, and SD of catches per species.\n\ncatch |>\n  group_by(species) |>\n  summarize(n=n(),mn=mean(num),sd=sd(num)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\n#R|    species n  mn       sd\n#R|  1     BLG 5 6.4 5.504544\n#R|  2     LMB 5 5.0 5.049752\n#R|  3     YEP 5 6.0 4.000000\n\n\n \n\n\nMultiple Values to Receive Zeroes\nSuppose that the fish data included a column that indicates whether the fish was marked and returned to the waterbody or not.\n\n\n#R|    ID species  tl marked\n#R|  1  1     BLG 148    YES\n#R|  2  1     BLG 153    YES\n#R|  3  1     BLG 147    YES\n#R|  4  1     BLG 149    YES\n#R|  5  1     BLG 144    YES\n#R|  6  1     BLG 145    YES\n\n\nThe catch and number of fish marked and returned per gear set ID and species may again be computed with group_by() and summarize(). Note, however, the use of ifelse() to use a 1 if the fish was marked and a 0 if it was not. Summing these values returns the number of fish that were marked. Giving this data frame to complete() as before will add zeroes for both the num and nmarked variables as long as both are included in the list given to fill=.\n\ncatch2 <- fishdat2 |>\n  group_by(ID,species) |>\n  summarize(num=n(),\n            nmarked=sum(ifelse(marked==\"YES\",1,0)))\ncatch2\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 11 × 4\n#R|  # Groups:   ID [5]\n#R|        ID species   num nmarked\n#R|     <dbl> <chr>   <int>   <dbl>\n#R|   1     1 BLG        10       8\n#R|   2     1 LMB         5       2\n#R|   3     1 YEP         5       2\n#R|   4     2 LMB         9       5\n#R|   5     2 YEP         7       2\n#R|   6     3 BLG        12       3\n#R|   7     3 YEP         7       4\n#R|   8     4 BLG         1       0\n#R|   9     4 LMB        11       4\n#R|  10     4 YEP        11       7\n#R|  11     5 BLG         9       6\n\n\nThere are two things to note in this output. First, that there are no zeroes for num and nmarked for the same species and gear sets as before. Second, the summarization was across two groups but summarize() only removes one of the group_by() variables. Thus, this result is still grouped by ID as shown above, which will interfere with using complete() to add the zeroes. This grouping can be removed with ungroup() as shown below before using complete().\n\ncatch2 <- catch2 |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  complete(ID,species,fill=list(num=0,nmarked=0)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\ncatch2\n\n#R|     ID species num nmarked\n#R|  1   1     BLG  10       8\n#R|  2   1     LMB   5       2\n#R|  3   1     YEP   5       2\n#R|  4   2     BLG   0       0\n#R|  5   2     LMB   9       5\n#R|  6   2     YEP   7       2\n#R|  7   3     BLG  12       3\n#R|  8   3     LMB   0       0\n#R|  9   3     YEP   7       4\n#R|  10  4     BLG   1       0\n#R|  11  4     LMB  11       4\n#R|  12  4     YEP  11       7\n#R|  13  5     BLG   9       6\n#R|  14  5     LMB   0       0\n#R|  15  5     YEP   0       0\n\n\n \n\n\nMore Information that Does Not Get Zeroes\nSuppose there is a data frame called geardat that contains information specific to each gear set.\n\n\n\n\ngeardat\n\n#R|    ID mon year  lake run effort\n#R|  1  1 May 2018 round   1   1.34\n#R|  2  2 May 2018 round   2   1.87\n#R|  3  3 May 2018 round   3   1.56\n#R|  4  4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92\n#R|  5  5 May 2018  twin   2   0.67\n\n\nAnd, for the purposes of this example, suppose that we have summarized catch data WITHOUT the zeroes having been added.\n\ncatch3 <- fishdat2 |>\n  group_by(ID,species) |>\n  summarize(num=n(),\n            nmarked=sum(ifelse(marked==\"YES\",1,0))) |>\n  as.data.frame()\ncatch3\n\n#R|     ID species num nmarked\n#R|  1   1     BLG  10       8\n#R|  2   1     LMB   5       2\n#R|  3   1     YEP   5       2\n#R|  4   2     LMB   9       5\n#R|  5   2     YEP   7       2\n#R|  6   3     BLG  12       3\n#R|  7   3     YEP   7       4\n#R|  8   4     BLG   1       0\n#R|  9   4     LMB  11       4\n#R|  10  4     YEP  11       7\n#R|  11  5     BLG   9       6\n\n\nFinally, suppose that these summarized catch data are joined with the gear data such that the gear set specific information is shown with each catch.\n\ncatch3 <- right_join(geardat,catch3,by=\"ID\")\ncatch3\n\n#R|     ID mon year  lake run effort species num nmarked\n#R|  1   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     BLG  10       8\n#R|  2   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     LMB   5       2\n#R|  3   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     YEP   5       2\n#R|  4   2 May 2018 round   2   1.87     LMB   9       5\n#R|  5   2 May 2018 round   2   1.87     YEP   7       2\n#R|  6   3 May 2018 round   3   1.56     BLG  12       3\n#R|  7   3 May 2018 round   3   1.56     YEP   7       4\n#R|  8   4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     BLG   1       0\n#R|  9   4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     LMB  11       4\n#R|  10  4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     YEP  11       7\n#R|  11  5 May 2018  twin   2   0.67     BLG   9       6\n\n\nThese data simulate what might be seen from a flat database.\nWith these data, zeroes still need to be added as defined by missing combinations of ID and species. However, if only these two variables are included in complete() then zeroes will be added for mon, year, lake, run, and effort, which is not desired. These five variables are connected to or “nested” with the ID variable (i.e., if you know ID then you know the values of these other variables) and should be treated as a group. Nesting of variables can be handled in complete() by including the names of all the connected variables in nesting().\n\ncatch3 |> complete(nesting(ID,mon,year,lake,run,effort),species,\n                    fill=list(num=0,nmarked=0)) |>\n  as.data.frame()\n\n#R|     ID mon year  lake run effort species num nmarked\n#R|  1   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     BLG  10       8\n#R|  2   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     LMB   5       2\n#R|  3   1 May 2018 round   1   1.34     YEP   5       2\n#R|  4   2 May 2018 round   2   1.87     BLG   0       0\n#R|  5   2 May 2018 round   2   1.87     LMB   9       5\n#R|  6   2 May 2018 round   2   1.87     YEP   7       2\n#R|  7   3 May 2018 round   3   1.56     BLG  12       3\n#R|  8   3 May 2018 round   3   1.56     LMB   0       0\n#R|  9   3 May 2018 round   3   1.56     YEP   7       4\n#R|  10  4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     BLG   1       0\n#R|  11  4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     LMB  11       4\n#R|  12  4 May 2018  twin   1   0.92     YEP  11       7\n#R|  13  5 May 2018  twin   2   0.67     BLG   9       6\n#R|  14  5 May 2018  twin   2   0.67     LMB   0       0\n#R|  15  5 May 2018  twin   2   0.67     YEP   0       0\n\n\nIt is possible to have nesting with species as well.

As it turns out there are a few “tricks” to make a length frequency histogram appear as I expect most fisheries folks would want it to appear – primarily, left-inclusive (i.e., 100 would be in the 100-110 bin and not the 90-100 bin). In this post, I show how to construct a length frequency histograms with ggplot2 using my preferences.\nThe data are lengths of Lake Erie Walleye (Sander vitreus) captured during October-November, 2003-2014.1 My primary interest is in the tl (total length in mm), sex, and loc variables2 and I will focus on 2014 (as an example).1 These data are available in the FSAdata package and formed many of the examples in Chapter 12 of the Age and Growth of Fishes: Principles and Techniques book.2 See here for more details\n\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nWE <- dplyr::filter(WalleyeErie2,year==2014)\n\n \n\n\nBasic Length Frequency\nMaking the histogram (Figure 1) begins by identifying the data frame to use in data= and the tl variable to use for the x-axis as an aes()thetic in ggplot(). The histogram is then constructed with geom_histogram(), which I customize as follows:\n\nSet the width of the length bins with binwidth=.\nBy default the bins are centered on breaks created from binwidth=. The bins can be changed to begin on these breaks by using boundary= set to the desired value of a first break, regardless of whether that break is in the data or not. I use boundary=0 so that bins will start on breaks that make sense relative to binwidth= (e.g., 0, 25, 50, 75, etc.).\nBins are left-exclusive and right-inclusive by default. Use closed=\"left\" to make the bins the desired left-inclusive and right-exclusive.\nThe fill color of the bins is set with fill= (I prefer a slight gray).\nThe outline color of the bins is set with color= (defaults to the same as fill=; I prefer a dark boundary to make the bins obvious).\n\nThe scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_continuous() are primarily used to provide labels (i.e., names) for the y- and x-axes, respectively. By default, the bins of the histogram will “hover” slightly above the x-axis, which I find annoying. The expand= in scale_y_continuous() is used to expand the lower limit of the y-axis by a multiple of 0 (thus, not expand the lower-limit) and expand the upper limit of the y-axis by a multiple of 0.05 (thus, the upper-limit will by 5% higher than the tallest bin so that the top frame of the plot will not touch the tallest bin).33 The resultant plot was assigned to an object so that name must be typed and run to see the plot.\n\nlenfreq1 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 fill=\"gray80\",color=\"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\")\nlenfreq1\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Length frequency of histogram of Lake Erie Walleye, 2014.\n\n\n\n\nThis base object/plot can be modified by adding (using +) to it as demonstrated later.\n \n\n\nStacked by Other Variable\nIt may be useful to see the distribution of categories of fish (e.g., sex) within the length frequency bins (Figure 2). To do this, add fill= in the aes()thetic in ggplot() and set it equal to the variable that identifies the separation within each bin (e.g., sex). The bins will be stacked by this variable if position=\"stack\" in geom_histogram().4 The fill colors for each group can be set in a number of ways, but they are set manually below with scale_fill_manual().4 This is the default and would not need to be explicitly set below).\n\nlenfreq2 <- ggplot(data=WE,aes(x=tl,fill=sex)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=25,boundary=0,closed=\"left\",\n                 color=\"black\",position=\"stack\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"gray80\",\"gray40\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Number of Fish\",expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\")\nlenfreq2\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 stacked by sex.\n\n\n\n\nStacked histograms are difficult to interpret in my opinion. In a future post, I will show how to use empirical density functions to examine distributions among categories. For the time being, see below.\n \n\n\nSeparated by Other Variable(s)\nA strength of ggplot2 is that it can easily make the same plot for several different levels of another variable; e.g., separate length frequency histograms by sex (Figure 3). The plot (e.g., lenfreq from above) can be separated into different “facets” with facet_wrap(), which takes the variable to separate by within vars() as the first argument.\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_wrap(vars(sex))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex.\n\n\n\n\nIf the faceted groups have very different sample sizes then it may be useful to use a potentially different y-axis scale for each facet by including scales=\"free_y\" in facet_wrap() (Figure 4). Similarly, a potentially different scale can be used for each x-axis with scales=\"free_x\" or for both axes with scales=\"free\".\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_wrap(vars(sex),scales=\"free_y\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex with different frequency scales.\n\n\n\n\nPlots may be faceted over multiple variables with facet_grid() (Figure 5), where the variables that identify the rows and variables for a grid of facets are included (within vars()) in rows= and cols=, respectively. Both scales can not be “free” with facet_grid(), the scale can only be “free” within a row or column.\n\nlenfreq1 + facet_grid(rows=vars(loc),cols=vars(sex),scales=\"free_y\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Length frequency histogram of Lake Erie Walleye 2014 separated by sex and location of capture with different frequency scales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#R> png \n#R>   2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{h.ogle2019,\n  author = {Derek H.

In this post, I briefly demonstrate how to fit a VBGF to a single group of data and then provide several options for how to view the fit of the function to those data.\nI will use lengths and ages of Lake Erie Walleye (Sander vitreus) captured during October-November, 2003-2014 available in FSAdata package. These data formed many of the examples in Ogle et al. (2017). My primary interest here is in the tl (total length in mm) and age variables1. I focus on female Walleye from location “1” captured in 2014 in this example.21 See more details about the data.2 For succinctness, I removed year and sex as they only had one category after filtering and three variables related to the location of capture.\n\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nwf14T <- WalleyeErie2 |>\n  filter(year==2014,sex==\"female\",loc==1) |>\n  select(-year,-sex,-setID,-loc,-grid)\nheadtail(wf14T)\n\n#R|       tl    w      mat age\n#R|  1   445  737 immature   2\n#R|  2   528 1571   mature   4\n#R|  3   380  506 immature   1\n#R|  323 488 1089 immature   2\n#R|  324 521 1408   mature   3\n#R|  325 565 1745   mature   3\n\n\n \n\n\nFitting the VBGF\nMethods for fitting a von Bertalannfy growth function (VBGF) are detailed in Ogle (2016) and Ogle et al. (2017). Thus, this methodology will only be briefly explained here.\nA function for the typical VBGF is constructed with vbFuns().33 Other parameterizations of the VBGF can be used with param= in vbFuns() as described in its documentation.\n\n( vb <- vbFuns(param=\"Typical\") )\n\n#R|  function (t, Linf, K = NULL, t0 = NULL) \n#R|  {\n#R|      if (length(Linf) == 3) {\n#R|          K <- Linf[[2]]\n#R|          t0 <- Linf[[3]]\n#R|          Linf <- Linf[[1]]\n#R|      }\n#R|      Linf * (1 - exp(-K * (t - t0)))\n#R|  }\n#R|  <bytecode: 0x00000264a9cedf90>\n#R|  <environment: 0x00000264aa86ae10>\n\n\nSome of the methods below use the fact that the three parameters of the typical VBGF (\\(L_{\\infty}\\), \\(K\\), \\(t_{0}\\)) can be given to this function separately (in that order) or as a vector (still in that order). For example, both lines below can be used to predict the mean length for an age-3 fish with the given VBGF parameters.44 The paramters could be given in a different order but would need to be named; e.g., vb(3,t0=-0.5,K=0.3,Linf=300).\n\nvb(3,300,0.3,-0.5)\n\n#R|  [1] 195.0187\n\ntmp <- c(300,0.3,-0.5) \nvb(3,tmp)\n\n#R|  [1] 195.0187\n\n\nReasonable starting values for the optimization algorithm may be obtained with vbStarts(), where the first argument is a formula of the form lengths~ages where lengths and ages are replaced with the actual variable names that contain the observed lengths and ages, respectively, and data= is set to the data frame that contains those variables.\n\n( f.starts <- vbStarts(tl~age,data=wf14T) )\n\n#R|  $Linf\n#R|  [1] 645.2099\n#R|  \n#R|  $K\n#R|  [1] 0.3482598\n#R|  \n#R|  $t0\n#R|  [1] -1.548925\n\n\nThe nls() function is typically used to estimate parameters of the VBGF from observed data. The first argument is a formula that has lengths on the left-hand-side and the VBGF function created above on the right-hand-side. The VBGF function has the ages variable as its first argument and then Linf, K, and t0 as the remaining arguments (just as they appear here). Again, the data frame with the observed lengths and ages is given to data= and the starting values derived above are given to start=.\n\nf.fit <- nls(tl~vb(age,Linf,K,t0),data=wf14T,start=f.starts)\n\nThe parameter estimates are extracted from the saved nls() object with coef().\n\ncoef(f.fit)\n\n#R|        Linf          K         t0 \n#R|  648.208364   0.361540  -1.283632\n\n\nBootstrapped confidence intervals for the parameter estimates are computed by giving the saved nls() object to Boot() (from car) and giving the saved Boot() object to confint().\n\nf.boot1 <- Boot(f.fit)  # Be patient! Be aware of some non-convergence\nconfint(f.boot1)\n\n#R|  Bootstrap bca confidence intervals\n#R|  \n#R|             2.5 %      97.5 %\n#R|  Linf 619.2082363 682.2018777\n#R|  K      0.3049448   0.4290073\n#R|  t0    -1.5180162  -1.0576519\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fit Using stat_function()\nHere all “layers” of the plot will use the same data; thus, data= and the aes()thetic mappings are defined in ggplot(). Observed lengths and ages are added to the plot with geom_point(). The points in Figure 1 were made slightly larger than the default (with size=) and also with a fairly low transparency value to handle considerable over-plotting. scale_y_continuous() and scale_x_continuous() control aspects of y- and x-axes, respectively – labels for axes are given in name=, minimum and maximum limits for the axis are in limits=, and specific major breaks for the axis are in breaks=.5 Finally, the fitted model line is added to the plot with stat_function() with the VBGF function created above in fun= and a list of arguments to this function in args=.6 In Figure 1 I made the model line a little wider than the default. Finally the theme() was modified to remove the minor grid lines from both axes.75 seq(0,700,100) makes a vector of numbers from 0 to 700 in increments of 100 and 0:11 makes a vector of integers from 0 to 11.6 The usage here exploits the fact that all three parameters of the VBGF can be given in the first parameter argument, Linf=.7 Thus the gridlines only appear for labelled axis breaks.\n\nggplot(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",\n                     limits=c(0,700),breaks=seq(0,700,100)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=coef(f.fit)),linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe model line can be displayed outside the range of observed ages by including minimum and maximum values in xlim= over which the function in fun= will be evaluated. In Figure 2 I add a dashed line for the model that includes evaluation at ages outside the observed range of ages (first stat_function()) and then plotted the model line for observed ages on top of that (second stat_function()). This gives the impression of using a dashed line only for the ages that would be extrapolated.88 I would usually change the axis expansion factors here to clean this plot up a bit.\n\nggplot(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=coef(f.fit)),\n                xlim=c(-1,12),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  stat_function(fun=vb,args=list(Linf=coef(f.fit)),linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014. The dashed line shows the model fit outside the range of observed ages.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fit Using geom_smooth()\ngeom_smooth() can use nls() to fit the VBGF “behind the scenes” and then add the resultant model line to the plot. For this purpose geom_smooth() requires method=\"nls\" and se=FALSE.9 In addition, arguments for fitting the VBGF required by nls() must be in a list given to methods.args=. Minimum required arguments for fitting the VBGF are the VBGF formula= and start=ing values as shown for nls() above. Figure 3 uses geom_smooth() in this way to reproduce Figure 1.9 se=FALSE is required because this argument is not implemented in nls().\n\nggplot(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"nls\",se=FALSE,\n              method.args=list(formula=y~vb(x,Linf,K,t0),start=f.starts),\n              color=\"black\",linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fit from Predicted Values\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 can also be constructed from lengths predicted at a variety of ages “outside” of any ggplot() layers. Using this method begins by creating a function to predict the mean length-at-age from model fit results. For use in the next section, this function must have the nls() object as its only argument. To meet this requirement we must use a trick that assumes that the ages to make the predictions at are in a vector called ages.1010 The function created here for this purpose is called predict2().\n\npredict2 <- function(x) predict(x,data.frame(age=ages))\n\nA vector of ages over which the fitted model will be evaluated is then constructed. In this case the ages extend beyond the observed range of ages. The seq()uence produce here will have 101 age values between -1 and 12.1111 Use a larger value for length.out= to make the line produced further below more smooth.\n\nages <- seq(-1,12,length.out=101)\n\nThe mean length at each of these ages is then predicted with the new prediction function (i.e., predict2() here). The vector of ages and predicted mean lengths are then put into a data frame for plotting below.1212 Here the data frame is called pred1 and it has two variables named age and plen.\n\npred1 <- data.frame(age=ages,\n                    plen=predict2(f.fit))\nheadtail(pred1)\n\n#R|        age      plen\n#R|  1   -1.00  63.17547\n#R|  2   -0.87  90.03596\n#R|  3   -0.74 115.66322\n#R|  99  11.74 642.36300\n#R|  100 11.87 642.63138\n#R|  101 12.00 642.88743\n\n\n \nThese predicted mean lengths-at-age are then used to add a fitted model line to a plot of observed lengths-at-age with geom_line(). However, because the observed and predicted data are in different data frames, the data= and mapped aes()thetics are declared within the appropriate geoms rather than within ggplot(). For example, geom_point() is used below to add the observed data to the plot and geom_line() is used below to add the modeled line. Note below that separate geom_line()s are used to show the modeled line over extrapolated and observed ages.13 The results in Figure 4 reproduce Figure 2.13 Also note the use of filter() to reduce the predicted lengths-at-age to the observed ages.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=wf14T,aes(x=age,y=tl),size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  geom_line(data=pred1,aes(x=age,y=plen),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data=filter(pred1,age>=0,age<=11),aes(x=age,y=plen),linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014. The dashed line shows the model fit outside the range of observed ages.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fit with Confidence Band\nThe main reason for introducing the idea of constructing a graphic from predicted values is that it allows for the opportunity to add a confidence band around the fitted model line (Figure 5).\nCreation of this plot requires modifying the data frame of predicted mean lengths at age with bootstrapped confidence intervals for the mean length at each age. Bootstrapped samples of prediction mean lengths at each age given the VBGF are constructed by giving Boot() (from car) the saved nls() object AND the new prediction function (created above) in f=. The object returned from Boot() is then given to confint() to extract the confidence intervals. These results, along with the vector of ages14 and the predicted mean lengths at each age, are then put into a data frame e.1514 ages was created above.15 Because confint returns a matrix with two columns, the names of the variables must be added wih names() after the data frame is created.\n\n# Be patient! Be aware of some non-convergence\npred1 <- data.frame(ages,predict2(f.fit),\n                    confint(Boot(f.fit,f=predict2)))\nnames(pred1) <- c(\"age\",\"plen\",\"LCI\",\"UCI\")\nheadtail(pred1)\n\n#R|         age      plen       LCI      UCI\n#R|  V1   -1.00  63.17547  13.41976 102.2830\n#R|  V2   -0.87  90.03596  46.59002 124.5242\n#R|  V3   -0.74 115.66322  77.46766 145.9582\n#R|  V99  11.74 642.36300 617.46285 671.5594\n#R|  V100 11.87 642.63138 617.50114 672.0041\n#R|  V101 12.00 642.88743 617.63552 672.4580\n\n\nA confidence band for mean lengths at age is added to the plot with geom_ribbon() where the lower part of the ribbon is at the lower confidence values (i.e., ymin=LCI) and the upper part is at the upper confidence value (i.e., ymax=UCI).16 fill= gives the color of the enclosed ribbon.16 Add geom_ribbon() first so that it is behind the points and model lines.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_ribbon(data=pred1,aes(x=age,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI),fill=\"gray80\") +\n  geom_point(data=wf14T,aes(y=tl,x=age),size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  geom_line(data=pred1,aes(x=age,y=plen),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data=filter(pred1,age>=0,age<=11),aes(x=age,y=plen),linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014 with a 95% confidence band. The dashed line shows the model fit outside the range of observed ages.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdd Equation to Plot\nThe following function can be used to extract the model coefficients from an nls() object and place them into a “plotmath” format to be added to the ggplot graph.\n\nmakeVBEqnLabel <- function(fit,digits=c(1,3,3)) {\n  # Isolate coefficients (and control decimals)\n  cfs <- coef(fit)\n  Linf <- formatC(cfs[[\"Linf\"]],format=\"f\",digits=digits[1])\n  K <- formatC(cfs[[\"K\"]],format=\"f\",digits=digits[2])\n  # Handle t0 differently because of minus in the equation\n  t0 <- cfs[[\"t0\"]]\n  t0 <- paste0(ifelse(t0<0,\"+\",\"-\"),formatC(abs(t0),format=\"f\",digits=digits[3]))\n  # Put together and return\n  paste0(\"TL==\",Linf,\"~bgroup('[',1-e^{-\",K,\"~(age\",t0,\")},']')\")\n}\n\n \nThe object returned from this function can be added to the ggplot graph with annotate() as shown below.1717 The x=, y=, hjust=, and vjust= arguments are used to position and justify the text and may take some trial-and-error to get what you want.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_ribbon(data=pred1,aes(x=age,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI),fill=\"gray80\") +\n  geom_point(data=wf14T,aes(y=tl,x=age),size=2,alpha=0.1) +\n  geom_line(data=pred1,aes(x=age,y=plen),linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data=filter(pred1,age>=0,age<=11),aes(x=age,y=plen),linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor=element_blank()) +\n  annotate(geom=\"text\",label=makeVBEqnLabel(f.fit),parse=TRUE,\n           size=4,x=Inf,y=-Inf,hjust=1.1,vjust=-0.5)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014 with a 95% confidence band.

However, these types of plots can be more flexibly constructed using ggplot2. Below I will use ggplot2 to recreate many of the plots shown in the documentation for plot() and plotAB().\n \n\n\nData\nThe WhitefishLC data frame from FSA.1 contains age readings made by two readers on scales, fin rays, and otoliths, along with consensus readings for each structure.1 These data are loaded automatically with library(FSA).\n\nhead(WhitefishLC)\n\n#R|    fishID  tl scale1 scale2 scaleC finray1 finray2 finrayC otolith1 otolith2\n#R|  1      1 345      3      3      3       3       3       3        3        3\n#R|  2      2 334      4      3      4       3       3       3        3        3\n#R|  3      3 348      7      5      6       3       3       3        3        3\n#R|  4      4 300      4      3      4       3       2       3        3        3\n#R|  5      5 330      3      3      3       4       3       4        3        3\n#R|  6      6 316      4      4      4       2       3       3        6        5\n#R|    otolithC\n#R|  1        3\n#R|  2        3\n#R|  3        3\n#R|  4        3\n#R|  5        3\n#R|  6        6\n\n\nIntermediate and summary statistics for the comparison of paired ages (e.g., between consensus scale and otolith ages) can be extracted from the objected returned by ageBias() from FSA.22 As described in the documentation.\n\nab1 <- ageBias(scaleC~otolithC,data=WhitefishLC,\n               ref.lab=\"Otolith Age\",nref.lab=\"Scale Age\")\n\nFor example, the $data object of ab13 contains the original paired age estimates, the differences between those two estimates, and the mean of those two estimates.3 ab1 because that was the name assigned to the results from ageBias() in this example.\n\nhead(ab1$data)\n\n#R|    scaleC otolithC diff mean\n#R|  1      3        3    0  3.0\n#R|  2      4        3    1  3.5\n#R|  3      6        3    3  4.5\n#R|  4      4        3    1  3.5\n#R|  5      3        3    0  3.0\n#R|  6      4        6   -2  5.0\n\n\nIn addition, the $bias object of ab1 contains summary statistics of ages for the first structure given in the ageBias() formula by each age of the second structure given in that formula. For example, the first row below gives the number, minimum, maximum, mean, and standard error of the scale ages that were paired with an otolith age of 1. Additionally there is a t-test, adjusted p-value, and a significance statement for testing whether the mean scale age is different from the otolith age. Finally, confidence intervals (defaults to 95%) for the mean scale age at an otolith age of 1 is given, with a statement about whether a confidence interval could be calculated.44 See the documentation for ageBias() for the criterion used to decide if the confidence interval can be calculated.\n\nhead(ab1$bias)\n\n#R|    otolithC  n min max     mean        SE          t   adj.p   sig       LCI\n#R|  1        1  9   1   2 1.444444 0.1756821  2.5298218 0.28212 FALSE 1.0393208\n#R|  2        2  7   1   5 2.000000 0.5773503  0.0000000 1.00000 FALSE 0.5872748\n#R|  3        3 17   1   6 3.352941 0.2416423  1.4605937 0.81743 FALSE 2.8406824\n#R|  4        4 18   2   6 3.833333 0.2322102 -0.7177407 1.00000 FALSE 3.3434126\n#R|  5        5  8   4   8 5.250000 0.4909902  0.5091751 1.00000 FALSE 4.0889926\n#R|  6        6 10   3   6 4.600000 0.2666667 -5.2500003 0.00686  TRUE 3.9967581\n#R|         UCI canCI\n#R|  1 1.849568  TRUE\n#R|  2 3.412725  TRUE\n#R|  3 3.865200  TRUE\n#R|  4 4.323254  TRUE\n#R|  5 6.411007  TRUE\n#R|  6 5.203242  TRUE\n\n\nThe results in $bias.diff are similar to those for $bias except that the difference in age between the two structures is summarized for each otolith age.\n\nhead(ab1$bias.diff)\n\n#R|    otolithC  n min max       mean        SE          t   adj.p   sig         LCI\n#R|  1        1  9   0   1  0.4444444 0.1756821  2.5298218 0.28212 FALSE  0.03932075\n#R|  2        2  7  -1   3  0.0000000 0.5773503  0.0000000 1.00000 FALSE -1.41272519\n#R|  3        3 17  -2   3  0.3529412 0.2416423  1.4605937 0.81743 FALSE -0.15931758\n#R|  4        4 18  -2   2 -0.1666667 0.2322102 -0.7177407 1.00000 FALSE -0.65658738\n#R|  5        5  8  -1   3  0.2500000 0.4909902  0.5091751 1.00000 FALSE -0.91100742\n#R|  6        6 10  -3   0 -1.4000000 0.2666667 -5.2500003 0.00686  TRUE -2.00324188\n#R|           UCI canCI\n#R|  1  0.8495680  TRUE\n#R|  2  1.4127252  TRUE\n#R|  3  0.8652000  TRUE\n#R|  4  0.3232540  TRUE\n#R|  5  1.4110074  TRUE\n#R|  6 -0.7967581  TRUE\n\n\nThese data frames are used in ggplot2 code below to create various versions of age-bias and difference plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAt times multiple data frames will be used when constructing the same plot so that layers of the plot can have different variables.\n\n\n \n\n\nBasic Age-Bias Plot\nFigure 1 is the age-bias plot created by default by plotAB() from FSA.\n\nFSA::plotAB(ab1)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Default age-bias plot from plotAB() in FSA.\n\n\n\n\n \nFigure 1 is largely recreated (Figure 2) with the following ggplot2 code.\n\nggplot(data=ab1$bias) +\n  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),width=0) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),shape=21) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Recreation of the default age-bias plot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nThe specifics of the code above are described below.\n\nThe base data used in this plot is the $bias data.frame discussed above.\nThe 45o agreement line (i.e., slope of 1 and intercept of 0) is added with geom_abline(), using a dashed linetype= and a gray color=. This “layer” is first so that it sits behind the other results.\nError bars are added with geom_errorbar(). The aes()thetics here map the consensus otolith age to the x= axis and the lower and upper confidence interval values for the mean consensus scale age at each consensus otolith age to ymin= and ymax=. The color= of the lines are mapped to the sig variable so that points that are significantly different from the 45o agreement line will have a different color (with scale_color_manual() described below). Finally, width=0 assures that the error bars will not have “end caps.”\nPoints at the mean consensus scale age (y=) for each otolith age (x=) are added with geom_point(). Again, the color= and fill= are mapped to the sig variable so that they will appear different depending on whether the points are significantly different from the 45o agreement line or not. Finally, shape=21 represents a plotted point as an open circle that is outlined with color= and filled with fill=.\nscale_fill_manual() and scale_color_manual() are used to set the colors and fills for the levels in the sig variable. Note that guide=\"none\" is used so that a legend is not constructed for the colors and fills.\nscale_x_continuous() and scale_y_continuous() are used to set the labels (with name=) and axis breaks for the x- and y-axes, respectively. The names are drawn from labels that were given in the original call to ageBias() and stored in ab1.\n\nThe gridlines and the size of the fonts could be adjusted by modifying theme theme, which I did not do here for simplicity.\n \n\n\nMore Examples\nBelow are more examples of how ggplot2 can be used to recreate graphs from plot() in FSA. For example, Figure 3 is similar to Figure 2, but uses $bias.diff from ab1 to plot mean differences between scale and otolith ages against otolith ages. The reference for differences is a horizontal line at 0 so geom_abline() from above was replaced with geom_hline() here.\n\nggplot(data=ab1$bias.diff) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),width=0) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),shape=21) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,\"-\",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Age difference plot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n \nFigure 4 is similar but it includes the raw data points from $data and colors the mean (and confidence intervals) for the differences based on the significance as in Figure 2. Because data were drawn from different data frames (i.e., ab1$data and ab1$bias.diff) the data= and aes= arguments had to be moved into the specific geom_s.

The smoother should be fit to the raw data so be sure to use ab1$data in geom_smooth(). The smoother defaults to blue (as shown here) but I decreased the width of the line slightly with linewidth=0.65.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),alpha=0.1,size=1.75) +\n  geom_errorbar(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LCI,ymax=UCI,color=sig),\n                width=0) +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$bias.diff,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean,color=sig,fill=sig),\n             shape=21,size=1.75) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"white\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"FALSE\"=\"black\",\"TRUE\"=\"red3\"),guide=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=seq(0,25,1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=paste(ab1$nref.lab,\"-\",ab1$ref.lab),breaks=-15:5) +\n  geom_smooth(data=ab1$data,aes(x=otolithC,y=diff),linewidth=0.65)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Age difference plot using ggplot2 including points for individual observations and a loess smoother.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhat Prompted This\nGraphics made in ggplot2 are more flexible than the ones produced in FSA. For example, a user recently asked if it was possible to make an “age-bias plot” that used “error bars” based on the standard deviation rather than the standard error. While it is questionable whether this is what should be plotted, it is nevertheless up to the user and their use case. Because this cannot be done using the plots in FSA we turned to ggplot to make such a graph.\nStandard deviations are not returned in any of the ageBias() results (saved in ab1). However, the standard error and sample size are returned in the $bias data frame. The standard deviation can be “back-calculated” from these two values using SD=SE*sqrt(n). Two new variables called LSD and USD that are the means minus and plus two standard deviations can then be created. All three of these variables are added to the $bias data frame using mutate() from dplyr.\n\nab1$bias <- ab1$bias %>%\n  mutate(SD=SE*sqrt(n),\n         LSD=mean-2*SD,\n         USD=mean+2*SD)\n\nA plot (Figure 6) like the very first plot above but using two standard deviations for the error bars is then created by mapping ymin= and ymax= to LSD and USD, respectively, in geom_errorbar(). Note that I removed the color related to the significance test as those don’t pertain to the results when using standard deviations to represent “error bars.”\n\nggplot(data = ab1$bias)+\n  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x=otolithC,ymin=LSD,ymax=USD),width=0) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=otolithC,y=mean)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name =ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Mean scale age for each otolith age with error bars represented by two standard deviations.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to demonstrate the flexibility of using ggplot with these type of data, I used a violin plot to show the distribution of scale ages for each otolith age while also highlighting the mean scale age for each otolith age (Figure 7). The violin plots are created with geom_violin() using the raw data stored in $data. The group= must be set to the x-axis variable (i.e., otolith age) so that a separate violin will be constructed for each age on the x-axis. I filled the violins with grey to make them stand out more.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_abline(slope=1,intercept=0,linetype=\"dashed\",color=\"gray\") +\n  geom_violin(data=WhitefishLC,aes(x=otolithC,y=scaleC,group=otolithC),\n              fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=ab1$bias,aes(x=otolithC,y=mean),size=2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=ab1$ref.lab,breaks=0:25) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=ab1$nref.lab,breaks=0:25)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Violin plots and mean scale age at each otolith age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{lant2021,\n  author = {Michael Lant},\n  title = {Age {Bias} {Plots} in Ggplot2},\n  date = {2021-03-15},\n  url = {https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR//blog/posts/2021-3-15-AgeBiasPlots},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMichael Lant. 2021, March 15.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe following packages are loaded for use below. The data are also from FSAdata, which is not loaded below. I also set the default ggplot theme to theme_bw() for a classic “black-and-white” plot (rather than the default plot with a gray background).\n\n\n\nlibrary(FSA)     # for vbFuns(), vbStarts(), confint.bootCase(), headtail()\nlibrary(car)     # for Boot()\nlibrary(dplyr)   # for filter(), mutate()\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\n \n\nIntroduction\nIn a previous post I demonstrated how to plot the fit of a von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) for a single group of observed data. In this post, I explore methods to do the same for multiple groups of observed data (e.g., multiple sexes, locations, years).\nI will again use the lengths and ages of Lake Erie Walleye (Sander vitreus) captured during October-November, 2003-2014 available in FSAdata package. These data formed many of the examples in Ogle et al. (2017). My primary interest here is in the tl (total length in mm), age, and sex variables1. I initially focus on Walleye from location “1” captured in 2014 in this example.21 See more details about the data.2 For succinctness, I removed year as it only had one level after filtering and three variables related to the location of capture.\n\ndata(WalleyeErie2,package=\"FSAdata\")\nw14T <- WalleyeErie2 |>\n  filter(year==2014,loc==1) |>\n  select(-year,-setID,-loc,-grid)\nheadtail(w14T)\n\n#R|       tl    w    sex      mat age\n#R|  1   445  737 female immature   2\n#R|  2   528 1571 female   mature   4\n#R|  3   499 1138   male   mature   4\n#R|  612 521 1408 female   mature   3\n#R|  613 565 1745 female   mature   3\n#R|  614 530 1553   male   mature   5\n\n\nAs in the previous post, a function that uses the typical VBGF to predict mean length given a set of VBGF parameters and age is needed.33 Other parameterizations of the VBGF can be used with param= in vbFuns() as described in its documentation.\n\n( vb <- vbFuns(param=\"Typical\") )\n\n#R|  function (t, Linf, K = NULL, t0 = NULL) \n#R|  {\n#R|      if (length(Linf) == 3) {\n#R|          K <- Linf[[2]]\n#R|          t0 <- Linf[[3]]\n#R|          Linf <- Linf[[1]]\n#R|      }\n#R|      Linf * (1 - exp(-K * (t - t0)))\n#R|  }\n#R|  <bytecode: 0x0000021bacf7c9a0>\n#R|  <environment: 0x0000021bacfb6f90>\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fits Using geom_smooth()\nOne of the simpler ways to plot multiple VBGF fits uses geom_smooth(), which, as described in the previous post, uses nls() to fit the model “behind-the-scenes.” Given this uses of nls() a set of starting values is needed. It is critical to note, though, that this method will only work if the same starting values can be used for each group in the data. With this warning, possible starting values for the optimization algorithm may be obtained with vbStarts(), where the first argument is a formula of the form lengths~ages where lengths and ages are replaced with the actual variable names that contain the observed lengths and ages, respectively, and data= is set to the data frame that contains those variables.\n\n( f.starts <- vbStarts(tl~age,data=w14T) )\n\n#R|  $Linf\n#R|  [1] 591.1587\n#R|  \n#R|  $K\n#R|  [1] 0.3930388\n#R|  \n#R|  $t0\n#R|  [1] -1.544479\n\n\nThe use of geom_smooth() to produce separate lines for the groups is exactly as described in the previous post except that the variable to identify the groups (i.e., sex in this example) must be mapped to the color= aes()thetic. For Figure 1 I also used scale_color_manual() to demonstrate how to change colors of the points and lines. Addition, I altered the theme to move the legend/guide into the plot panel and to remove the default sex label that would appear on top of the legend.44 In this case the legend is placed 80% down the x-axis and 20% up the y-axis.\n\nggplot(data=w14T,aes(x=age,y=tl,color=sex)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"male\"=\"darkblue\",\"female\"=\"darkred\")) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"nls\",se=FALSE,\n              method.args=list(formula=y~vb(x,Linf,K,t0),start=f.starts),\n              linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank(),\n        legend.position=c(0.8,0.2),\n        legend.title=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to male and female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n \nAn alternative visualization is to put the two groups into separate panels using facet_wrap().5 Note that color is superfluous in Figure 2, but I kept it for comparison to Figure 1. However, mapping color to a variable will cause a legend to be produced by default. This legend, however, is redundant with the panel labels, so it was removed in theme() below.5 Simply put the grouping variable inside of vars() as the argument to facet_wrap().\n\nggplot(data=w14T,aes(x=age,y=tl,color=sex)) +\n  geom_point(size=2,alpha=0.3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"male\"=\"darkblue\",\"female\"=\"darkred\")) +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"nls\",se=FALSE,\n              method.args=list(formula=y~vb(x,Linf,K,t0),start=f.starts),\n              linewidth=1) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank(),\n             legend.position=\"none\") +\n  facet_wrap(vars(sex))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to male and female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFitting the VBGF to Multiple Groups\nMethods for fitting a von Bertalanfy growth function (VBGF) to multiple groups are detailed in Ogle (2016) and Ogle et al. (2017). Thus, this methodology will only be briefly explained here.\nFitting the VBGF to multiple groups requires creating an expression, rather than a function, with the VBGF defined over the multiple groups. The expression below codes the VBGF using the length and age variables from the data set used here (i.e., tl and age) and assuming different parameters should be estimated for each group.6 Identifying the different groups is accomplished here by appending [group], where group is replaced with the specific variable name that identifies the groups (i.e., sex here). The expression is assigned to an object name (i.e., vbLKt here).6 See the linked resources for examples of how to fit the VBGF assuming situations where some parameters differ and some do not across groups.\n\nvbLKt <- tl~Linf[sex]*(1-exp(-K[sex]*(age-t0[sex])))\n\nFor use below, I identify the “groups” (with unique()) and create an object that contains the number of groups (with length()).\n\n( grps <- unique(w14T$sex) )\n\n#R|  [1] female male  \n#R|  Levels: female male\n\n( ngrps <- length(grps) )\n\n#R|  [1] 2\n\n\nThis model has six parameters – \\(L_{\\infty}\\), \\(K\\), and \\(t_{0}\\) for each of the two groups (male and female walleye). Starting values must be declared for each of these parameters. Here I find starting values from the data ignoring the groups (using vbStarts() as described in the previous post) and replicate those starting values for both groups.7 Map replicates the starting values in the list from vbStarts() with rep (the replicated function), the object returned from vbStarts(), and a numeric vector that explains how many times each parameter should be repeated (i.e., the same as the number of groups).7 In some instances using the same starting values for both groups will not result in model convergence. The linked resources provide suggestions for handling those cases.\n\n( sv0 <- vbStarts(tl~age,data=w14T) )\n\n#R|  $Linf\n#R|  [1] 591.1587\n#R|  \n#R|  $K\n#R|  [1] 0.3930388\n#R|  \n#R|  $t0\n#R|  [1] -1.544479\n\n( svLKt <- Map(rep,sv0,c(2,2,2)) )\n\n#R|  $Linf\n#R|  [1] 591.1587 591.1587\n#R|  \n#R|  $K\n#R|  [1] 0.3930388 0.3930388\n#R|  \n#R|  $t0\n#R|  [1] -1.544479 -1.544479\n\n\nThe model is then fit to the data by including the VBGF expression object, data=, and start= as arguments to nls(). The estimated parameters may be extracted from the saved nls() object with coef(). Note that the parameters will be appended with numbers in the alphabetical order of the groups.8 Thus, in this example, it is seen that the estimated \\(L_{\\infty}\\) for females is greater than that for males.8 Unless your chose to order the levels of the group variable differently.\n\nfitLKt <- nls(vbLKt,data=w14T,start=svLKt)\ncoef(fitLKt)\n\n#R|        Linf1       Linf2          K1          K2         t01         t02 \n#R|  648.2083813 574.1512545   0.3615399   0.3354067  -1.2836317  -1.9702829\n\n\n \n\n\nModel Fits from Predicted Values\nThe model fits can also be shown for predicted values, both within and outside the observed range of ages. This, however, first takes a bit of work outside of ggplot to prepare the relevant data.\nIn particular, a data frame that contains predicted mean lengths at age over the range of observed ages for all groups is needed. I being this process by finding (and assigning to an object for later use) the range of ages for each group.\n\narng <- w14T |>\n  group_by(sex) |>\n  summarize(min=min(age),\n            max=max(age))\narng\n\n#R|  # A tibble: 2 × 3\n#R|    sex      min   max\n#R|    <fct>  <int> <int>\n#R|  1 female     0    11\n#R|  2 male       1    11\n\n\nFrom this, I create a temporary vector of 101 ages9 evenly spaced over a range of ages larger than what was observed.109 Use a larger value for length.out= to make the line produced further below more smooth.10 Zero was an observed age here, if not I usually make sure it is included.\n\natmp <- seq(-1,12,length.out=101)\n\nI then create a data frame that has the name of each group repeated as many times as there ages in the temporary age vector (i.e., 101 here) and then has the ages in the temporary age vector repeated for each group (i.e., twice here). Note the careful use of each= and times= in the two uses of rep() below.\n\npreds <- data.frame(sex=rep(grps,each=length(atmp)),\n                    age=rep(atmp,times=ngrps))\nheadtail(preds)\n\n#R|         sex   age\n#R|  1   female -1.00\n#R|  2   female -0.87\n#R|  3   female -0.74\n#R|  200   male 11.74\n#R|  201   male 11.87\n#R|  202   male 12.00\n\n\nPredicted mean lengths at each age for each group is then appended to this data frame by giving the fitted nls() object and this data frame to predict().\n\npreds <- preds |>\n  mutate(ptl=predict(fitLKt,preds))\nheadtail(preds)\n\n#R|         sex   age       ptl\n#R|  1   female -1.00  63.17550\n#R|  2   female -0.87  90.03599\n#R|  3   female -0.74 115.66324\n#R|  200   male 11.74 568.37143\n#R|  201   male 11.87 568.61804\n#R|  202   male 12.00 568.85411\n\n\nFinally, I add a fourth variable that will be TRUE if the age is within the range of observed ages for the group. This is accomplished with the code below that creates a new preds data frame. That code can be a little tricky to understand, so lets walk through a couple parts of it. First, note that the group_by() acts sort of like a loop here in the sense that what follows that line will be completed for the first group, then the second group, and so on. In the next snippets, consider that we are working the the “female” group. In this case, unique(sex) will return female such that arng[arng$sex==unique(sex),] will find the row of arng where its sex variable is equal to “female”. The $min appended to that will extract just the value in the min variable of that row (so the minimum observed age for females). The age>=arng[arng$sex==unique(sex),]$min portion is thus asking if the age variable in preds is greater than or equal to the minimum observed age for females. If it is it will return TRUE, otherwise FALSE is returned. The second part of that mutate() line asks if the age variable in preds is less than or equal to the maximum observed age for females, again returning TRUE or FALSE as appropriate. Those two conditions are then connected with an & such that if they are both TRUE then a TRUE is returned, otherwise a FALSE is returned. The result is that the new inrng variable will be TRUE if the age variable within preds is within the observed range of ages for the sex given in the sex variable of preds.1111 FSA::peek() is used here to show an evenly spaced 20 rows in the data frame. This provides more output than headtail() for observing the results of code.\n\npreds <- preds |>\n  group_by(sex) |>\n  mutate(inrng=age>=arng[arng$sex==unique(sex),]$min &\n               age<=arng[arng$sex==unique(sex),]$max)\nFSA::peek(preds)\n\n#R|         sex   age      ptl inrng\n#R|  1   female -1.00  63.1755 FALSE\n#R|  11  female  0.30 282.5622  TRUE\n#R|  21  female  1.60 419.6791  TRUE\n#R|  32  female  3.03 511.9351  TRUE\n#R|  43  female  4.46 566.9479  TRUE\n#R|  53  female  5.76 597.4205  TRUE\n#R|  64  female  7.19 617.9233  TRUE\n#R|  74  female  8.49 629.2802  TRUE\n#R|  85  female  9.92 636.9214  TRUE\n#R|  96  female 11.35 641.4779 FALSE\n#R|  106   male -0.48 225.8590 FALSE\n#R|  117   male  0.95 358.5543 FALSE\n#R|  128   male  2.38 440.6943  TRUE\n#R|  138   male  3.68 487.8581  TRUE\n#R|  149   male  5.11 520.7348  TRUE\n#R|  159   male  6.41 539.6122  TRUE\n#R|  170   male  7.84 552.7712  TRUE\n#R|  181   male  9.27 560.9168  TRUE\n#R|  191   male 10.57 565.5938  TRUE\n#R|  202   male 12.00 568.8541 FALSE\n\n\nThe following code is redundant with what was done above, but it shows how the making of preds can be put together in one piped workflow.\n\npreds <- data.frame(sex=rep(grps,each=length(atmp)),\n                    age=rep(atmp,times=ngrps)) |>\n  mutate(ptl=predict(fitLKt,preds)) |>\n  group_by(sex) |>\n  mutate(inrng=age>=arng[arng$sex==unique(sex),]$min &\n               age<=arng[arng$sex==unique(sex),]$max)\nFSA::peek(preds)\n\n#R|         sex   age      ptl inrng\n#R|  1   female -1.00  63.1755 FALSE\n#R|  11  female  0.30 282.5622  TRUE\n#R|  21  female  1.60 419.6791  TRUE\n#R|  32  female  3.03 511.9351  TRUE\n#R|  43  female  4.46 566.9479  TRUE\n#R|  53  female  5.76 597.4205  TRUE\n#R|  64  female  7.19 617.9233  TRUE\n#R|  74  female  8.49 629.2802  TRUE\n#R|  85  female  9.92 636.9214  TRUE\n#R|  96  female 11.35 641.4779 FALSE\n#R|  106   male -0.48 225.8590 FALSE\n#R|  117   male  0.95 358.5543 FALSE\n#R|  128   male  2.38 440.6943  TRUE\n#R|  138   male  3.68 487.8581  TRUE\n#R|  149   male  5.11 520.7348  TRUE\n#R|  159   male  6.41 539.6122  TRUE\n#R|  170   male  7.84 552.7712  TRUE\n#R|  181   male  9.27 560.9168  TRUE\n#R|  191   male 10.57 565.5938  TRUE\n#R|  202   male 12.00 568.8541 FALSE\n\n\n \nFigure 3 is created with the code below that largely combines similar code from the previous post and the use of color= provided above. In brief, geom_point() is used to add points at the observed lengths at age, the first geom_line() adds the fitted models as dashed lines from the predicted mean lengths at all ages in preds, and the second geom_line() adds the fitted models solid lines from the predicted mean lengths only at observed ages for each group.1212 Note the use filter() in the second geom_line() so that only data for which inrng==TRUE is used.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=w14T,aes(x=age,y=tl,color=sex),\n             size=2,alpha=0.3) +\n  geom_line(data=preds,aes(x=age,y=ptl,color=sex),\n              linewidth=1,linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data=filter(preds,inrng),aes(x=age,y=ptl,color=sex),\n              linewidth=1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name=\"Total Length (mm)\",limits=c(0,700)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(name=\"Age (years)\",breaks=0:11) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"male\"=\"darkblue\",\"female\"=\"darkred\")) +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank(),\n        legend.position=c(0.8,0.2),\n        legend.title=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Fit of typical von Bertalanffy growth function to male and female Lake Erie Walleye in 2014.

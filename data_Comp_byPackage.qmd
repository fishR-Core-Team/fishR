The following list is a comprehensive(?) list of fisheries related datasets found in packages that exist on CRAN. Datasets from packages not controlled by the fishR Core Team (i.e., `FSA` and `FSAdata`) are entered manually, so please submit a GitHub Issue (see link at bottom of right sidebar menu) with any corrections or additions. This list was last updated on `r format(Sys.Date(),format="%B %d, %Y")`.

```{r}
#| include=FALSE
source("helpers/data_helpers.R")
```

```{r}
#| results='asis'
## Datasets from other packages are manually entered into
##   DataFromOtherPackages.xlsx.
tmp <- readxl::read_excel("helpers/DataFromOtherPackages.xlsx") %>%
  select(-starts_with("Entered"))
## Database of datasets in FSA and FSAdata, with other packages appended
fish_db <- rbind(prepare_db("FSA"),prepare_db("FSAdata"),tmp)

maketable(fish_db,pkgs=unique(fish_db$Package),showPkg=FALSE)
```

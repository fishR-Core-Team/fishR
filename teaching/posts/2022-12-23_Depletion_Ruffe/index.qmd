@czypinski_evaluating_2011 performed an experiment to determine if a population of invasive [Ruffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruffe) (*Gymnocephalus cernuus*) could be significantly reduced by sequential removal of Ruffe with bottom trawls. The following catches of Ruffe were made at the [Kakagon River](https://www.wisconsinwetlands.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Kakagon-Bad-River-Sloughs.pdf) location with the corresponding minutes of trawling effort.

```
Sample    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10
--------------------------------------------------------
Catch   282  346   27    4    9   27    4    0    1    0
Effort 19.0 30.0 31.0 20.0 29.5 42.5 34.5 36.0 27.0 25.0 
```

&nbsp;

1. Enter the catch and effort data into separate R vectors and create a vector that represents CPE in each sampling period. Carefully interpret the meaning of the first value in the CPE vector.
1. What is the best estimate and 95% confidence interval for the initial population size?^[Note that @czypinski_evaluating_2011 used the Ricker modified formula.]
1. What is the best estimate and 95% confidence interval for the catchability coefficient? Very carefully interpret what this estimate means relative to the capture of Ruffe at this site.

&nbsp;

4. Suppose that 5 minutes of trawling was considered to be one unit of effort. Convert the effort vector accordingly and calculate a new CPE vector. Carefully interpret the meaning of the first value in the CPE vector.
1. What is the best estimate and 95% confidence interval for the initial population size? How does this estimate compare to the same estimate from using the original effort data? What does this mean?
1. What is the best estimate and 95% confidence interval for the catchability coefficient? How does this compare to the same estimate from using the original effort data? What does this mean?

&nbsp;

7. What is the best estimate for the percentage of the Ruffe population that was removed in all trawling efforts at this site?

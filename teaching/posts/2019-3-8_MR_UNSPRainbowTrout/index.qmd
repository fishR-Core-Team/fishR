@warrenetal_2004 examined the population of [Rainbow Trout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_trout) (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) in the [Upper Niagara Springs Pond](https://idfg.idaho.gov/wma/niagara-springs) in 2000. Fish were captured at two times by using an electrofishing unit attached to a driftboat. The capture history of all fish examined in the two samples that were 100 mm and longer is in [RBTroutUNSP](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/reference/RBTroutUNSP.html).^[See “CSV file” link in “Source” section of linked page.] Use these data to answer the following questions.

1. Create a summary of the capture histories.
1. From your capture history summary assign values to each of $M$, $n$, and $m$.^[Symbols are as used in @ogleIntroductoryFisheriesAnalyses2016.]
1. Construct an appropriate population estimate, with a 95% confidence interval, for Upper Niagara Springs Pond Rainbow Trout in 2000. Carefully interpret the results.
1. Which method did you use to construct the confidence interval? Explain why you chose that method.

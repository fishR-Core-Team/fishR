# Introduction
A large number and variety of data sets are provided in the `FSA` and `FSAdata` packages, which I collectively call here the "fishR data." Lists of the data available in these packages are available [alphabetically ordered](../../../pages/data_fishR_alpha.html) or [arranged by fisheries topic](../../../pages/data_fishR_byTopic.html).^[A more comprehensive list of fisheries data in all CRAN packages is [here](../../../pages/data_Comp_byPackage.html).] Items on those lists are linked to a documentation file where the origin of the data, its variables, and other items are described. This is a rich source of open-source data that can be used for teaching purposes.

Data sets in `FSA` and `FSAdata` can be, as with data in all packages, accessed with `data()` by including the name of the data as the first argument and the package name in `package=`. For example, the `WalleyeErie2` data from `FSAdata` are loaded below.

```{r}
data(WalleyeErie2,package="FSAdata")
head(WalleyeErie2)
```

&nbsp;

While this method for accessing these data is efficient, I don't like to use it with students because in the "real world" they will not be accessing data from an R package, rather they will be using their own data stored in some other format. With students just learning R I usually have them load CSV files that I either provide for them or they produce themselves.^[We also discuss the advantages of CSV files -- lightweight, not proprietary, etc.] They then load the data with `read.csv()` from base R.^[For more advanced students I will use `read_csv()` from `readr`.]

&nbsp;

# Using CSV Files
To aid use of the fishR data as CSV files we have provided links to the raw CSV files in the R documentation,^[For example,  (e.g., try `?FSAdata::WalleyeErie2`.] in the [on-line documentation](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/FSAdata/reference/WalleyeErie2.html), or in the [PDF documentation on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FSAdata/FSAdata.pdf). In all instances you will see a highlighted "CSV file" link at the end of the description in the "source" section of documentation (@fig-exCSVlink). Pressing this link will bring up the raw CSV file which can then be saved to your personal computer.^[Alternatively, right-click on the CSV link to save the file.]

```{r}
#| label: fig-exCSVlink
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Partial view of the online documentation for `WalleyeErie2` data set in `FSAdata` showing the "CSV file" link.
knitr::include_graphics("exCSVlink.png")
```

&nbsp;

Students can link directly to URL for the CSV file but this requires a connection to the internet (each time the data is loaded) and does not help students learn how to organize data on their own computers.

```{r}
WalleyeErie2 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fishR-Core-Team/FSAdata/main/data-raw/WalleyeErie2.csv")
head(WalleyeErie2)
```

However, this last example also demonstrates how an instructor could link directly to the CSV file in the resources they provide the student.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion
In summary, we hope you will take advantage of the data resources provided in the `FSA` and `FSAdata` packages. However, we encourage you **not** to have students access the data through `data()` but instead to use the CSV files linked to in the documentation as described above.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: hide
source("../../../helpers/_helpers_posts.R")
sc2pv()
```
